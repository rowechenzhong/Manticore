Artist Sayed Kandil, who won the State Incentive Award in Visual Arts last month, spoke to Rania Khallaf about his work
Painting a good portrait is one of the hardest tasks, as it requires skill and patience. But making a graphic art portrait is even harder. Sayed Kandil — the professor of graphic arts at the Faculty of Fine Arts, Helwan University who won the State Incentive Award for 13 large silkscreen portraits collectively called “Humanities” last month — is one of a handful of artists who master this genre. Having become dean of the faculty at the age of 44 — the youngest in its history — in 2011, Kandil is not as familiar a face on the art scene as he might be. But he has given 14 solo exhibitions in the course of his career.
“Revolutionary Portraits”, a 2014 exhibition at the Picasso Gallery, commemorated the 25 January Revolution with emotionally expressive faces executed in swift, harsh lines. “The art of portraiture,” he tells Al-Ahram Weekly at his Dokky studio, “is not about drawing the features of someone’s face; it goes far beyond that. It requires a special sense of expression; an understanding of what lies beneath the skin. The fantastic thing about making portraits is observing that unique expressive energy in every human encounter of the artist’s.”
Kandil belongs firmly in the 1990s, but he was lucky enough to be taught by the veteran graphic artist Hussein Fawzi (1905-1999). Fawzi was the first to draw his attention to the significance of anatomy. “He told me he needed to feel and touch the flesh when looking at my portraits. Since then, my vision of portraits has completely changed.” After graduating in 1990, Kandil spent a year doing his army service, sketching and contemplating fellow conscripts’ faces. In 1991 he produced a collection of drawings on wood, “Goodbye, Guardians of Values”, which use the scarecrow as a central motif.
In 1997, he won a nine-month scholarship to Bordino University in Italy, where he studied lithography — not then available in Egypt. It was an opportunity to make landscape watercolours from life as well. His 1995 MA focused on Edvard Munch, the godfather of expressionism, whose influence on Kandil remains deep. His 1998 PhD on the African and Germanic roots of German expressionism took this interest further. In the meantime Kandil travelled. In Uzbekistan he found “a unique mix of races” and cultures. He fell in love with the urbane and civilised Tunisians.
“Studying expressionism made an impact on my work. I subconsciously became more drawn to emotional expressions, so I resorted to another medium — wood engraving — which is much easier and faster and enables me to track my feeling immediately, transferring the emotion while it is fresh.” But in 2014, when his term as dean ended, he switched to watercolour and pastel, moving onto silkscreen soon after. “The 25 January Revolution had a tremendous effect on me. Watching faces of people in the streets, and the martyrs, feeling the state of fervour and uproar during those revolutionary years. I got so emotional I often burst into tears.”
Now, Kandil has embarked on a new creative phase focusing on the human figure. “We Egyptians tend to look at the human body, especially at the female body, with great disrespect. This is very annoying. I want to regain that lost respect by casting light on the beauty of the human body. Drawing the human body is quite hard, because it involves combining the physical and the spiritual presence.” But, roaming around the studio, the present writer can tell that, however much he challenges himself, it won’t be too hard for Kandil.
One remarkable portrait, 70cm by 100cm, features a woman with thick lips, half-closed eyes and huge nostrils. It is executed like a landscape, showing a range of terrains and natural features. The woman is in pain, and so is the land she stands for. Kandil’s faces are weathered and emphatically African and always full of drama, which gives them a unique power to make you stop and listen to the inner voice of the artist. Another painting shows a smiling, middle-aged woman next to the head of a strange, abstract and slightly frightening bird.
Kandil’s new work will soon be on display.-  and straight model has a round tip: 18mm including 510 fitting

Misha B is arguably one of the most interesting artists to come out of The X Factor. Her career so far however has been somewhat disappointing. That being said, the third single Here's To Everything - from her as yet to be titled debut album - has the ingredients to be a great summer pop song. It cleverly samples a Fugee's classic and with Misha's undeniable vocal talent, you get one great pop stomper. This is one to watch on the charts!As if you needed any more proof of the quickly-evolving basketball terror that is Anthony Davis, check out this incredible sequence from Pelicans-Nets game on Sunday.
Late in the first quarter, Deron Williams, owner of one of the nastiest crossovers in the league, has Davis dead to rights for his signature crossover-into-step back jumper. Or, so he thinks. Davis, with his albatross arms, is all “oh yeah, bro?”, and casually swats it into the arms of a waiting Eric Gordon. Davis, noticing the ball coming down into his teammate’s hands, immediately streaks past the Nets’ last line of defense, the hapless Mirza Teletovic, who doesn’t stand a chance at catching up.
The Pelicans ultimately lost the game, 93-82, but plays like this are why everyone should be excited/scared of Davis, our future defensive overlord.Macroeconomics subjects to write about in an essay

Soprano Adrienne Danrich Shares Techniques with Music Students at a Master Class Before Performance
March 6, 2013
Soprano Adrienne Danrich shares techniques with music major and aspiring opera singer Elizabeth Payne at Monday's Master Class in Marian Anderson Music Center
Three promising voice students from Cheyney University of Pennsylvania's Department of Humanities and Communication Arts were chosen to attend a master class with soprano Adrienne Danrich on Monday morning, March 4. Ms. Danrich was on campus to present “This Little Light of Mine: The Stories of Marian Anderson and Leontyne Price" for the Arts and Lectures Series.
Soprano Elizabeth Payne seemed to put any nervousness aside as she stepped on the stage to sing Porgi amor, from Mozart's opera Le Nozze di Figaro with a clear, resonant voice. Afterward, Danrich offered some advice. "You are your best teacher - inside your body you have to know what you feel." The CU senior and aspiring opera singer is going to Hampton, VA this month to participate in the Mid-Atlantic National Association of Negro Business Professional Women’s Club, Inc. competition. In addition, she will present her senior recital and travel to Boston in May to compete in the Auditions Plus Vocal Competition.
Janina Jones, the second performer, sang Edward Boatner’s arrangement of the spiritual Oh, What a Beautiful City. Ms. Danrich remarked about her distinct vocal quality: “I love your instrument,” Danrich said about Janina's distinct vocal quality. Danrich went on to offer suggestions for enhancing the delivery of the text. “It is our job is to explain the text. The song means something - think about the words, how you feel about them and make an impression. Our job is to communicate,” she stated.
Craig Brown-Dickens, a sophomore, was the final performer and offered an arrangement of the spiritual Were You There? by Marques L. A. Garrett, director of the Cheyney University Concert Choir. Ms. Danrich told the audience of singers, faculty, and family supporters, "I like this song! I'm going to use it." She then told Craig "Find that hook - that note - that sound in it - that goes back and over and use it."
Ms. Danrich encouraged the students and gave feedback throughout the session and reminded them that "the technique gets us through the tired times because you still have to communicate whether you're tired or not. You've got to use your breath to get you through. When you're singing," she advised, "make it different every time and just get out of the way."
Although the students said at first they were nervous to work with someone other than their voice instructor, Dr. Sebronette Barnes-Aborom, they agreed that they were leaving the master class equipped with some new tools and confidence and that they had all learned from one of the best.
Dr. Barnes-Aborom stated that the master class was a component of the Arts and Lectures Series. “When our guest speakers and artists come to campus, we arrange for them to meet with students in small groups based on their disciplines. The Academic Engagement is the strength of the Arts and Lectures Series.”
Danrich made her solo debut at Carnegie Hall with the New England Symphonic Ensemble in Beethoven’s Mass in C and Mozart’s Mass in G,and performed arias and duets by Vivaldi with the Cape Cod Symphony Orchestra at her Alice Tully Hall debut with The Little Orchestra of New York. When Ms. Danrich sang Beethoven's Ninth Symphony for the first time with the Cape Cod Symphony Orchestra.Related searches: school assistant, school hour, secondary school, independent school, independent schools, primary school, school teaching, boarding school, school manager, after school... more »

MSSR is our signature program to highlight our student’s need for an intensive focus in three core skill areas: phonological processing, reading comprehension, and college entrance test preparation. We believe that a daily emphasis on these areas will provide the necessary remediation to build a strong foundation for the application of strategies and development of critical thinking skills.
Students in grades 3-11 are assessed in September to determine placement in one of three reading intensives: Orton-Gillingham, Reading Comprehension, SAT Test and Writing Prep. The following assessment tools are utilized to determine appropriate placement:
• Gray Oral reading Test
• Woodcock Johnson Reading Mastery Test
• Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing
• DIBELS
• Nonsense Word Test
• San Diego Quick Assessment
• Test of Word Reading Efficiency
Following the assessment, students are placed in an MSSR intensive learning block for 45 minutes daily. This period allows for students to receive explicit, direct instruction in a small group with concentrated instruction on specific skills that are targeted to build a strong reading foundation for struggling students. It is not uncommon for students to enter the Pinnacle Academy with a significant deficit in core skills such as spelling patterns, vocabulary development, and oral language. Our commitment to closing learning gaps begins with mastery of these core skills.Refining our message/
During a recent meeting I spent almost 90 minutes outlining the vision for a project to a team member. Initially I was frustrated by the amount of time it took my audience to "buy in" to the concepts and strategy I presented. Only later did I realize it was equally my own failing in not preparing my message properly to be easily understood. As I look over the messaging and vision surrounding The Idea Pump I realize it too needs clarity and conviction to the core message. What is The Idea Pump? What do we stand for? What do we believe in? How do we help others? This may sound like fluffy headed thinking for a business but I believe the business represents the people in it as much as the people represent the business.
Over the coming days you will see the story and vision of The Idea Pump refined here. Less marketing speak and more clear belief. An approach to doing what is right for as many people as possible. A restatement of what The Idea Pump stands for: helping people do the right things at the right time in the right way.

Follow Ups:Some people might not even like being and Aunt. Sometimes it means getting your hair pulled, and sometimes it means getting all worn out with 2 and 3 year olds climbing all over your body and pushing on the uncomfortable parts. But here are some fun things that I discovered about being an Aunt. (They correspond to the pictures... and though there were more fun things, I decided to limit it to these.) And honestly, I think parents do a lot of these things too.... All this is from when I went to Boston for a week towards the end of January. (less than a week after we got back from Williamsburg!)
1) Being an Aunt is fun when you can go "sailing" on comforters in the middle of the floor. Incidentally, this is almost as fun and not quite as energy-dependent as "going to the zoo".
2) Being an Aunt means I can read as many stories as I want all day long....and make them up too! (Actually, some of you may know that I do this even when I'm not "being an Aunt".)
3) Being an Aunt means that I get to go to a playground, pretend I'm a real photographer, and have almost as much fun as the girls!
5) Being an Aunt means that I can cook something strange every once in a while. This happens to be octopus (or squid? I'm not sure, actually). I know Margaret doesn't look very excited, but she and Adelynn both put away quite a bit. Adelynn had never had any before and had picked it out at Costco as her "special treat." She told me about it a few days later and assured me that she would share it with me....that it would be our special treat.
6) Being an Aunt means I can have TEA PARTIES at the genuine tea time of 4 o' clock every day because a) it's when the girls get up from nap time, and b) they always want a snack right then. So even though they're only 2 and 3, we get out the nice china and the tea cups and we have cheese and bread and fruit for snacks! SO fun. Every day after the first, the girls would ask me if they could have a tea party. What did I say? "YES!"
And finally, 7) An Aunt and her nieces can have "girl time" when we pull out two enormous bags of little household items and set up a whole miniature house! I know it sounds so 5 year old of me, but it was SO fun!
You are a wonderful auntie! Grannies do some of the very same things:) Your nieces are blessed to have you fly up whenever you feel like it.
I feel like you would be the best aunt ever, and am sad you are not MY kids' aunt. :)
You are as cute as your nieces! I'm glad you have discovered the joys of being an aunt.Cart:

COL.As you already know by now I love maxi dresses, especially trendy cheap sundresses. They are pretty easy to style and look incredible no matter how you wear them.
They’ve become a major staple, not only because they are really flattering to any body shape but because they are perfect trasitional pieces.
If you want to appear sexy, but you also consider yourself to be sophisticated and stylish, choose a high slit maxi dress like this one from RoseGal.
This dress sums up a few major trends all in one and that’s the reason why it’s a fashion must have: floral print, bright colours and 70’s vibes make this dress a winner!
Especially love the high slit, which makes the dress particularly comfortable and sultry. It allows us to move freely while looking trendy on our go-to outfits, and that’s our prerogative these days, am I wrong?
Here are my tips on how to wear the prettiest floral maxi dress. Same dress 3 different styles:
CASUAL SUMMER STYLE
Best way to stay cool and chic in the summer’s heat. Style this beatiful maxi dress with flat sandals and a raffia bag, a simple yet trendy outfit that works for any occassion from a casual sunday stroll to a lunch date.

ROCK-CHIC STYLE

In the end, garden ideas are truly successful when satisfactory care is considered along with beautification of your garden.
Container Gardening - Among the easiest and most affordable ways to showcase your creative gardening skills is through container gardening. Many attractive landscapes are shaped in containers of varied sizes and shapes. It can be a single container consisting of various small vegetation, or different multi-colored containers comprising various plants. There is no limit to how you can use them. Additionally, container gardening also solves the condition of limited space. It really is economical, easy to install and maintain, not a problem while shifting or relocating making pot gardening one of the most popular garden ideas.
Organic and natural Gardening - Started in the United States through the 1940s and 1950s, organic gardening is basically based on the concept of feeding the land and not the seed. It believes that trees, crops are all part of something in nature. Organic and natural gardeners do not use any man-made fabricated fertilizers, nutrients or pesticides. They effectively apply the natural manure, compost or homemade infestations controls for flower nutrition. They grow plants suitable for the conditions available. The organic garden ideas follow decorum with the nature, for a wholesome environment.White 2mg xanax Original 37.5 phentermine oral Xanax Wagon Rims Buy hoodia diet natural appetite suppressant And

Being overweight and hypertensionThe lovely thing about being three-quarters retired is that, on some days, I can do all kinds of things that I certainly couldn't do when I was working.
On Tuesday I went into Edinburgh and was a 'lady-who-lunches' with my friend Shirley. We had a really nice meal at Jamie Oliver's in Rose Street and lots of time to catch up. She also bought me my birthday present, which is a bee house. Can't wait for the winter to disappear and then see what bees we can attract to our garden.
Yesterday was Old Lady Badminton. It was the first game back after my cartilage diagnosis and the news isn't that great. I played a good game and won both games I played, but my knee was very sore. I suppose the only good thing is that it didn't give way or lock. I was wearing a support, but next time I'll wear a stronger one and see if that makes a difference.
Today, on a cold and snow filled morning, while Mountain Man was off at a work thing, Lazy Boy and I snuggled down on the bean bag to watch Andy Murray win through to the finals at the Australian Open, before heading off to a meeting in Kelso, by which time the roads were pretty much clear of the white stuff.
And to cap it all, today I got a card with a fab photo of my lovely Odi with her trainer, Emma, from Forfar Guide Dog School.
Yup, all in all a pretty good week so far.victor's cafe in new york city toronto lawn and tennis club find owners any company in florida. transfer case diagram for the samurai vince neil date of birth? meaning of te falta un poco call of duty 5 m rating: what fuel does solar cars use. free online mario games for boys, cape TEENnappers golf course new zealand. calculate weight loss based on calories consumed 3d application laser microfabrication principle. pet friendly hotels in tacoma alabama estate keller real williams... best way to build upper chest the games we used to play bodybag its kinda like lyric underminded.

Granted, I don’t know how big the boy will be when he pops out. Plus, they all grow up really, really FAST, I know. But takkan lah anak aku tak payah pakai baju? Sejuk lah dia kan, kan?
But still, sebab malas nak dengar banyak yap yapping, my boy only has 5 sleepsuits, 7 rompers, 5 pairs of socks, 1 cap and a pair of mittens. Anak orang lain, by the time lahir dah ada one closet full of clothes! Argh. Stress!
Thing is, if I were to just get those clothes (after all, my son, right? so, up to me lah kan? ahha), I’m still not sure which I should get. I’ve been going in and out of Mothercare, only to question myself – ni kan Malaysia, kena pakai long sleeves and long pants all the time ke? Tapi at the same time my mom asks me, “Eh Girl, baby 2 bulan lebih dah boleh pakai baju lengan pendek eh?”
HOH? Tak boleh ke?
I know it’s ridiculous sebab there are so many other things to worry about, I know. Tapi , I can’t help but be confused about what to put on my child. Plus, things like berapa lama nak kena bedung dia (sebab I bought 2 swaddling blankets and now tak sure if membazir ke apa) and whether kalau dah swaddle kena selimut lagi tak? Ke panas sangat? And whether or not I should expose my baby to chemicals (baby bath, lotion, etc) as soon as dia lahir or just mandikan dengan air per se since babies don’t smell bad at all. Sebab there’s always 2 (or worst, 3 or 4) versions of things and this person buat like this and the other buat like that. Bikin aku pening, please!
Oh, and according to my mom, masa kecik, none of my siblings dipakaikan talcum powder anywhere on our bodies. It reduces chances of getting rashes, especially at places like celah-celah kaki, leher, butt and armpit. So, I’ve got to remind whoever handling my baby not to put talcum powder sesuka hati jugak. See, bikin pening lagi sebab certain people lumur anak with powder tapi tak ada apa pulak. Hmmm.
Oh, if you happen to be wondering if I have a checklist for my boy, of course I do. I live on checklists! But of course, I don’t follow it in toto because I know certain things are just totally and completely unnecessary pun. But here’s the whole list, just in case you want to get things for your baby.You can adjust accordingly, of course.

So, ngeri tak tengok list?
I know that I’ve bought most of the essentials, tapi everyone keeps telling me that it’s the small things yang akan buat panic nanti at the end of the day and those yang akan burn a hole in your pocket because you don’t have the time to make informed decisions about your purchases.
Sigh.
How now?
Have I missed out anything?
Am I ready to be Mama?
Truth is, I freak myself out.

6 comments:
haha i was just like you dulu.
trust me, the number of clothes tu dah cukup i rasa coz baby dont sweat pun. satu hari pakai 2 sets je then u basuh so cukupla rotate hari2. tp u will soon realise that u need to add a few more sbb kkdg baju x sempat basuh and all. plus, my boy pernah satu hari 3 kali tukar coz he wets himself and terkena his stool and all so just be prepared.
and mittens and booties or socks belilah lebih sikit :)
i bought a blanket but proved to be unnecessary sbb dah ada swaddler cukupla. plus, u dont want the baby to be wrapped all day long. we did that at first and his temperature zoomed. so nurse ckp during the day bukak2 la bedung tu. let his skin breathe.
and my baby pakai je short sleeve and sleeveles. during the day sebab kkdg panas kan.
AND, please go buy yourself a nipple cream. I didnt get one for myself sebab ingat takpe sapu dgn susu sendiri je after breastfeed. hoho, i had a hard time with breastfeeding, my nipple cracked, bled and sore. time tu takde nipple cream. memang menangis la. it helps to sooth a little if not much. so yes, prepare yourself for BF most importantly because it was a struggle for me at first.
just my 2 cents :) all the best kakak!
thanks for the tips! i read your comments dah the other day tapi tak sempat reply. hehe
hopefully everything will be okay!
uuu nervous hahhaha
OMG!!!
I didnt realized all the necessary things to prepare (per your longgggg check list)until i baca your list.. Mcm prepare nak pegi overseas pun ada hehehe... takutnyer nak ada baby...
funny thing is.. Y Breast pump tops the list? hahaha
PunchingBag :)
macam nak pergi overseas? overseas punya list pun lagi pendek please! baru kita tau kan, how much we have to spend on ONE child! hahahah.
why breastpump tops the list? easy!
1. dia antara benda paling mahal dalam list so put on top sebab have to put it as a priority; and
2. kalau kau cakap sunat tu sakit, mungkin kena kasi cuba bengkak susu! from what other moms have told me, mmg boleh nanges sakit dia.
hahahahhaah.
harap terjawab persoalan anda. tapi jgnlah smpai fikir 2000 kali nak kawen and ada baby pulak.
bakat dah ada dah tu ;p ;p ;p ;p
dear!
pls buy urself nipple cream and breast pad byk2!! very important stuff coz ure about to nurse every 2hrs and takut kena breast engorgement during the first two weeks..good luck! :)
anon: thanks for the tips. already bought the cream tp breastpad mmg tak lagii hahaGreen Beauty Products

From the first scent of sweetness on the nose, you know this is going to be good. Light pepper gives a little kick. Full and divinely textured fruit flavors of dark cherry, currant and a bit of mocha are quite balanced with a touch of duskiness. It doesn’t linger and is velvety smooth going down. This is immensely enjoyable from start to finish. It is an excellent value at around $20 for a wine of this caliber. Enjoy!

Officers who seized fertiliser during a raid on a drugs factory in Sparkbrook have donated unused bags to residents.
The fertiliser is now being used in hanging baskets and potted plants along Dearman Road.
Sgt Robert Grace from the Sparkbrook neighbourhood team said: “After closing the cannabis factory we wanted to extend the positive effects this had for the local community.
“The local residents should be commended for all the hard work that they have put into improving the local area.
“Not only do the flowers brighten up the area but research shows that when environmental improvements are made, people living in the area feel safer.”
Mary Mockbell, of Dearman Road, is vice-chairman of the Sparkbrook Neighbourhood Forum. She said: “Everyone on the road is incredibly grateful.
“The road looks amazing and the flowers and hanging baskets brighten up the area. Judges from the Britain in Bloom campaign have recently visited to inspect our hanging baskets and plants.”--Randy ( the lumper ;-)
Right now I prefer to play it safe & split as much as
possible. As I've said before, if you split & keep 'forms' true, then you can
always cross them when you find that 2 forms are the same species. If you cross
2 forms and then discover that they are different species, there's a chance that
you will lose 1 or both pure species in the hobby.
So the question now is whether it is better to be a lumper or a splitter.
Ongoing DNA studies are pointing to the probability that there are more distinct
species than mere geographic populations of apistos. DNA studies have already
shown that the genetic difference between A. caetei from the type locality (Rio
Caeté) and A. cf. caetei (Guamá) from the Rio Guamá are greater than the
difference in mitochondria between all species of Mbuna in Lake Malawi - and
this includes species in different genera! This is very disturbing to me
because these 2 forms are found in neighboring streams within a few miles of
each other. These 2 caetei-complex fish that are virtually identical when
preserved. The type form of A. caetei is somewhat more colorful than the Guamá
form when alive. Are these 2 forms distinct species? If we say they are the same
species, then do we lump all Malawi Mbuna into a single species?

Surrey
2017-02-03 09:02 PST
Surrey RCMP, ICBC, and Surrey Crime Prevention Society are once again reminding residents to take an active role in reducing their chances of becoming a victim of auto crime. Recently released Surrey RCMP crime statistics show theft from vehicles was up 22% in 2016 in Surrey.
On Saturday, February 4th a one day public and media event called Operation Protect It. Lock It. Keep It. will seek to enhance community safety and educate the public on ways they can reduce the incidence of theft from vehicles.
- February 4th, 2017 from 10:00am-2:00pm, Hillcrest Shopping Plaza (18696 Fraser Highway)
During the event, Surrey RCMP and Surrey Crime Prevention Society volunteers will be conducting parking lot audits and distributing information on auto crime prevention. A ‘Spot the Target’ vehicle will also be set up to help educate the public on various items that can be targets when left in vehicles.
We are pleased to support this event which targets a specific crime type which we have unfortunately seen a distinct increase in this past year, says Surrey RCMP Inspector Andy LeClair, Community Support and Safety Officer.
In addition to our enforcement efforts, there are a number preventative steps that the public can take to help reduce their chances of becoming a victim of auto crime in our city.
It’s important we all keep our guards up to protect ourselves from auto crime, said Karen Klein, ICBC Road Safety Coordinator.
Make sure your keys are secure at all times, lock your vehicle when it’s unattended and remove electronics and any valuables.
Vehicle crimes are often crimes of opportunity that can be prevented by applying some precautions to protect your vehicle and belongings:
- Park your vehicle in well-lit areas near pedestrian traffic.
- Keep your garage door opener hidden or take it with you.
- Keep your keys secure at all times. Don’t leave your keys unguarded — even at a restaurant or the gym.
- Always lock your doors and close your windows, even if you’re away from your vehicle for just a minute.
- Remove electronics and valuables including smartphones, GPS and keys. Put anything in the trunk that could tempt a thief— even loose change or empty shopping bags.
- Don’t store your spare or valet key in your vehicle.

Weekend Wrap-up!
We had a fabulous fall weekend! Yesterday, we woke up bright and early to visit the pumpkin patch at Gentry Farms. It opened at 9 right when we got there. There were less than 20 cars in the parking lot and Evie had the run of the place. It was so nice! Evie loved it. We took a hayride, went through a few mazes, played in corn, rode little tractors, and slid down a few slides. Evie's favorite part was sititing in the little house at the table with her "bowl." She loves little chairs so much and finds them everywhere she goes. We came home and put our pumpkins on the front step. Evie and Carl played outside for a bit. Nap time lasted four hours since our little pumpkin was worn out from her busy morning at the farm.
I took a little nap too and then headed out for a bit to run a few errands and enjoy a little time to myself. My favorite thing was taking my Sonic strawberry lemonade in the library and reading all the fun magazines! It was so wonderful to have a chance to get away for a bit! Simple things like that mean so much more to me now than before Evie.
Evie needed a Halloween costume so we took her to Halloween Express. Carl and I could not decide what to get her so we let her decide. She took every single ladybug costume off the rack so that was our clue that she wanted to be a ladybug. Our neighbors told us about a pizza place so we headed over there for some delicious pizza. We had planned to eat there but they only offered carry-out. It was so yummy and it was so funny seeing Evie devour that pizza. The owner had told us "that children really respond well to his pizza" and we think he was right! Evie pranced around the house in her new shoes and had some freshly baked warm chocolate chip cookies for dessert.
Evie slept or at least stayed quiet in her crib until almost 8:30. It was so nice to sleep in without my little blond alarm clock going off before the sun was up. We took a long walk in the park and worked in the yard a little. Evie is such a good helper. She helped rake the pine straw and pick up the pine cones from our dead tree. Evie took a nap while we did a few things around the house. Carl helped me catch up on some chores which helps get my week off to a great start. I took a nap and read a little after our chores were finished. Have you read South of Broad by Pat Conroy? It's really interesting so far but I usually like any book that is set in Charleston. Our friend Christina gave us a buy one get one free coupon for a new yogurt shop so we took advantage of the gorgeous day and enjoyed some yummy yogurt with lots of fun toppings. Carl had 9 oz and I had 3 oz so they got a good deal on us but he shared with Evie. I think Evie got more yogurt on her new cupcake shirt then she did inside her mouth but she sure had fun.
We stopped to play at Owl Creek park on the way home. Evie was amazed to see a HUGE hot air balloon landing practically in our backyard. It was so cool and really brought the neighbors out to enjoy the beautiful day. Evie made friends with a lady and her hair clips.
Evie was exhausted from her busy day and went to bed while we made some chicken fajitas for dinner. It's been a fun weekend! Hope you had a great weekend too.
Thank you for your comment!One investor who is a billionaire named Elon Musk made an announcement that created a firestorm for the man with a “Planetary Face” [i.e. – Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook fame]. Mr. Musk apparently plans to, (or has already), severed his ties to the Facebook creator. Why? By now the world knows of the severely negative controversy that swirls around the social media “boy blunder.” The Zuck Man made more than a few enemies over his political advocacy regarding immigration.
That’s just for starters, because a wide media spectrum reported the unfolding story. Traditional newspapers like U.S.A. today, & internet giant Huffington Post, are only two examples. In fact, it seems several news organizations additionally ran another story about Yammer founder David Sacks. He was formerly closely connected to Musk & is also distancing himself from Zuck brainchild, Fwd.us – the political startup at the center of this storm.
Has Fwd.us – created by Zuckerberg to advocate for immigration reform seemingly backfired? It would appear so, (at least temporarily to some degree), based upon the upheaval & uproar highlighted by investor ads being pulled or threatening such & other financial supporters, who verbalized their opposition. Basically, the problem is said to be that Fwd.us, while advocating for immigration reform that would otherwise represent a progressive move forward – additionally supports political suicide issues. These include the controversial Keystone pipeline project along with drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Fwd.us took powerful blows to the chin for its T.V. ads that act as campaign tools for targeted government legislators who support the dangerous environmental action cited above.
Elon Musk founded electric carmaker Tesla Motors, & he is said to be against the ads which some now seem convinced are promotional tools for “Big Oil & Gas.” One media report said that Mr. Musk initially backed Fwd.us – because he agrees with a reasoned positive plan for the white – hot topic, immigration reform. There was also word of several additional progressive groups pulling their ads from Facebook itself. If correct, it sends a signal to Zuckerberg that it is an act of protestation along the same lines as Musk & Sacks. Meanwhile, other backers of Fwd.us have remained behind it & the T.V. ads. These include Bill Gates along with other un-named tech giants.
Russ Feingold, the former Sen. from Wisconsin, & creator of liberal political action group Progressives United spoke out sharply against the founder of Facebook. Feingold & his group favor comprehensive immigration reform. But he is dead set against tying any legislation to promoting lawmakers who represent districts comprised of a clear majority of constituents, who are said to favor the Keystone & Arctic Wildlife energy projects.
The result of all this is Zuckerberg pulling campaign ads that had already run for about a week in seven states according to parties directly involved. The Huffington Post wrote that Kate Hanson made statements attempting to spin the whole mess, putting a positive “face” back on the tarnished Zuckerberg & his activities. She is a spokeswoman for Fwd.us, who logically would be expected to do all it can to plug the dike.

Looking to increase headcount in the remaining months of 2017? You’re not alone – according to the latest ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey (MEOS), Singaporean employers reported steady hiring intentions for the final quarter of 2017.
Interviewing over 59,000 employers across 43 countries, including 700 in Singapore, ManpowerGroup found that 16% of employers were expecting to increase staffing levels. On the other hand, 5% forecasted a decrease while 74% anticipated no change. This places Singapore’s Net Employment Outlook at +11% – the strongest forecast in two years.
When compared to the previous quarter, hiring prospects were found to be 7 percentage points stronger, and 4 percentage points stronger when compared with the final quarter of 2016.
Job gains were expected across all organisation sizes with large-sized employers (250 or more employees) reporting a Net Employment Outlook of +19%; the outlook for medium-sized businesses (50-249 employees) stood at +14%; small-sized businesses (10-49 employees) reported a outlook of +10%; while Micro employers were the most cautious with an outlook of +7%.
ALSO READ: What you need to know about hiring Singaporean graduates
Linda Teo, country manager of ManpowerGroup Singapore, said: “The rise in Net Employment Outlook might be attributed to employer confidence bolstered by Singapore’s recent economic growth, which grew by 2.7% in the first half of 2017/.”
“Although there’s a renewed confidence amongst employers, many remain wary and are adopting the wait-and-see mentality amidst worries that trade numbers could weaken and domestic demand may stall despite the potential pickup in trade,” she added.
Among the seven industry sectors (finance insurance and real estate, manufacturing, mining and construction, public administration and education, services, transportation and utilities, and wholesale trade and retail trade) employers in six sectors expected to grow payrolls during 4Q 2017.
Public administration and education sector employers reported the strongest hiring plans with a Net Employment Outlook of +22%. While uncertain hiring plans were reported in the mining and construction sector with an Outlook of -1%.
Elsewhere, employers in the services sector and the transportation and utilities sector forecasted a steady increase in staffing levels with Outlooks of +18% and +17%, respectively.
Employers in the finance, insurance and real estate sector employers anticipated some job gains with an Outlook of +8%, while Outlooks stand at +7% in the wholesale and retail trade sector and at +3% in the manufacturing sector.

“The stronger hiring outlook in the services sector reflects the expected surge in demand for IT specialists, especially those dealing with cyber operations and cyber security as more companies go digital,” Teo commented, in response to the upbeat forecast in the services sector.
She added: “Singapore’s Smart Nation project is also expected to drive demand for data scientists and software engineers besides cyber security specialists.”
During the October-December time frame, Payrolls were forecasted to grow in all eight countries and territories surveyed in Asia Pacific.
Compared to Q3 2017, hiring prospects improved in Singapore (+7%), India (+4%), Hong Kong (+2%), China (+2%), and Australia (+1%); declined in New Zealand (-2%) and Taiwan (-1%); and remained unchanged in Japan.
When compared to Q4 2016, forecasts strengthened in four countries ( Hong Kong, Singapore, China, and Taiwan), declined in three (India, New Zealand, and Australia) and was unchanged in one (Japan).

(AP)
Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her deputy Rahul Gandhi today refrained from commenting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech, with the party vice president saying it is not a day of politics.
“Today is not a day of politics. We will talk tomorrow,” he merely said, when asked by reporters on his reaction to the Prime Minister address on Independence Day.
Sonia Gandhi too steered clear of any questions and merely greeted reporters on Independence Day.
They were interacting with the media after the Congress President unfurled the national flag at the AICC headquarters.
In his address to the nation, the Prime Minister, while underlining India’s unity and diversity, said the poison of casteism and communal frenzy have no place and asserted that steps taken by his government in the last 15 months to deal with the “termite” of corruption had started yielding results.
“There is a lot of talk in our country about corruption. It is like a sick person giving suggestions to others on how to remain healthy, there are people who are themselves corrupt, who give suggestions on how to deal with corruption,” he said.
At the flag hoisting at AICC headquarters, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, P Chidambaram and several party leaders including general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi, Gurudas Kamat, C P Joshi were present.
After the unfurling of the flag, the Congress chief distributed sweets to children.
Rahul Gandhi is leading the Congress campaign against the government on the Lalit Modi controversy and Vyapam issues in which it is seeking the resignation of Union Minister Sushma Swaraj and chief ministers of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh Vasundhara Raje and Shivraj Singh Chouhan.Here's this weeks outfits!!

Transcript: Creating a Sciency Society
Fraser: Astronomy Cast episode 309 for Monday, June 3, 2013 – Creating a Sciency Society: Doing really well. Do we have anything we need to let people know to do? Just another reminder, although we’re still past the CosmoQuest hangout-a-thon, if you have some time and/or money by all means let people know about the fact that CosmoQuest is still looking for donations. Go to cosmoquest.org/donate. We’ve had people ask what the difference was between donating for CosmoQuest and donating for Astronomy Cast.
Pamela: Different sets of humans that do somewhat overlap so when you donate to Astronomy Cast you are paying for Preston to edit the show, you’re paying for Nancy Atkinson to prepare the show notes, you’re paying for transcription and you’re helping us with all the random things that we need varying from gears to hard drives to lighting which I’m clearly not using right now. Our attic is still a wreck from the hangout that we did over the weekend. When you donate to CosmoQuest you’re actually paying for us to generate additional science programs that you can take part in and help us discover our solar system. We have noisy astronomer Nicole Gugliucci on staff full time, Cory Lehan is our lead developer, Joe Moore is a graduate student who is a developer on the project, we have an educational team that is working on running a one week teacher development workshop this week and donating to CosmoQuest helps our three people who are our educational coordinators go out. We provide these teachers with things to use in their classroom as well as with content to use in their classroom. CosmoQuest just takes everything a whole lot further in enabling people to learn and do science more effectively.
Fraser: So I’ve got two things to promote. First thing is I’ve updated our phases of the moon app for Universe Today and we put really high resolution images into the phase app which is what people where complaining about. Now it looks really nice, when you zoom in it is really high resolution. I’m really happy with that. The second thing is that I’ve been doing a bunch of short explainer videos on my YouTube channel and I’ve been getting a lot of great feedback. They are like three minutes long and we cover one topic and those are on Universe Today’s YouTube channel which I think you may enjoy.
Pamela: Well if we’re still promoting things I’ve got one more thing.
Fraser: We’re out of time, we’re out of time!
Pamela: One more thing to add… 365 days of astronomy is still going. We introduced two recent series: Space Scoops which is designed for children and Weekly Space Stories. I’m narrating both of those under my narration name which is Pamela K Beyond. For professional reasons I keep the two separate. Please check those out. Enjoy your fiction and your space stories for kids.
Fraser: People always said you should do voice narration for things.
Pamela: And I took them up on it.
Fraser: Awesome. Okay great well lets get rockin’.
Fraser: Our modern society depends on science. It impacts the way we eat, work, communicate and play. And yet, most people take our amazing scientific advancement for granted, and some are even hostile to it. What can we do to spread the love of science through education, outreach and media? This is just non-stop baffling to me and I think you as well.
Pamela: Yeah
Fraser: We’re both super-geeks or super-nerds. I know there is some distinction between a geek and a nerd… whatever, I’m both. We have always been interested in science and technology and deeply appreciated the impact and roll that this plays in our lives. I know we’re preaching to the choir here with the people who listen to the show and watch what we do and come to our star parties every Sunday night. Someone said “This is the geekiest thing I’ve ever seen.” And I love it! I hope that you, watching this, understand just how much all of this really means to us and how much we appreciate it. The vast majority of society doesn’t.
Pamela: Does not get it… does not get it.
Fraser: …and yet they depend on it! They’ve got these magical phones… that’s not magic, it’s science that do all of these amazing things.
Pamela: GPS which requires relativity and physics and aerospace engineering.
Fraser: And people just take all this stuff for granted. In the worse cases, those of us in the skeptical movement really have to deal with this hostility towards science.
Pamela: Yeah, this notion that if I can’t instantly understand something and instantly understand its application it must be wrong, bad, dangerous, evil or just simply not worth while. That’s something I’ve run into a lot was the “Why should we fund what you do? You’re just an astronomer, you’re not giving back to society.” It wears on you after a while. It makes me think that my life would be more appreciated as a voice actress and it depresses me to no end that the going rate for an average actress is 10x the going rate for an astronomer.
Fraser: And yet there are hundreds of people that attempt to get every single astronomy position. There are a lot of people chasing a lot of jobs. What would a sciency-society (there I go making up words again) look like do you think?
Pamela: On the most simplistic level imagine if every science fiction television show or other form of speculative fiction show had a science adviser who was listened to with the same respect that Kevin Grazier eventually found himself being listened to on Battlestar Galactica. Imagine a society where people thought that it was cool and normal to problem solve how to fix something rather than just buying a new one. It’s that combination of having that respect to go out and find the person who has the know-how and ask and that desire to figure things out on your own like the makers society. If we can combine that respect for intellect and that respect and desire to be part of making things, I think that’s what it would look like. We’re not there though.
Fraser: (Laughs) Yeah and we’re really really fortunate in the science/ space community that we have found on Google+, on Twitter and science online. With these groups there are a lot of women that are actively engaged and when we see the Weekly Space Hangout it’s you, Amy Shira Teitel, Nicole, Emily Lakadwalla and there are just so many really knowledgeable women. That’s fairly rare when you look at the bigger numbers.
Pamela: It’s actually very odd selection effect. One of the things that you find is that by and large, more people that go into the physical sciences and engineering sciences are men. Of those who do, both men and women make it into the field but women are more likely to end up in the education research and the communication paths. What you’re seeing is in the sciences you’ve got lots and lots of men but you preferentially end up with women in the communication rolls.
Fraser: I’ve never really had anyone give me a hard time about my love of science and technology. Even growing up it was always encouraged. I went to engineering at UVC, I got my computer science degree but for you what was it like growing up as a woman who was that interested in science. Did you find this anti-sciency society was working against you?
Pamela: Well it’s not even just the anti-sciency but the anti-intellectual. You get tired of being smart being a curse and you can’t excel in science and try and hide your intelligence at the same time. You’re fighting the fact of “oh crud, I’m getting made fun of because I like science” and the “oh crud I’m getting made fun of because I’m smart”. Then you’re also facing all the gender bias from the physics teacher that gave me a C because he wanted to teach me a lesson about how women don’t belong in science and how it was better to learn young than waste my life trying to be a scientist. I wish this was a joke but this is what happened in my senior year of high school. It’s never ending from the “You don’t look like a scientist” with some shock, with a bit of apaulment when someone finds out. It gets to a point that you either go into a situation ready to apologetically admit that you’re a scientist or ready to own it with the type of self confidence that gets taken as “you’re scary”. It’s hard… it’s really just hard.
Fraser: Did you find that growing up for you that that kind of backlash or that sort of anti-intellectualism go hand in hand? Do you think that that sort of intellectualism and interest in science go hand in hand?
Pamela: I think of the people who fight to make it in science. You have to also at a certain level, at most levels be an intellectual. The pair down project for science is huge. In physics astronomy, in my personal classes, went from 70 people in the first astronomy class I took, most of them weren’t majors but that’s where the majors were. Next semester there were twelve of us. Of the twelve of us three of us got PhD’s. Of the three of us that got PhD’s, two of us are still in the field. I then went to Texas for graduate school. Of the 18 of us that started at Texas, three of us got PhD’s. That’s a huge pair down. Then you look at how many stay in the field after that. It’s just this constant loss of people just because there are not jobs and there are not positions and it is such a long hard flight.
Fraser: Then we look at what’s on popular television and you get… I don’t want to make this a rant about how bad society has gotten to kids these days and so on. You get Jersey Shore and you get all of these terrible reality shows and…
Pamela: It doesn’t have to be that way. It’s possible to have positive thought processes, it’s rare but it’s possible in these reality shows. One of my guilty pleasures is I watch on Hulu this SciFi channel reality show called Face Off which is about doing special effects make up. They’re forever saying “that you can’t do because that is not anatomically correct” and that’s people looking through anatomy books and looking at what exists in the natural world seeking inspiration and they are getting down-graded for not having things that are not physically realistic.
Fraser: So we also see situation where if you look at the Mythbusters which is a huge success. Mentally popular with people and that really crosses lines. Y get this situation where people are blowing things up and testing things that are gross and weird but if you peel that part of it back, there is a really good science lesson going on there. About testing, about putting in controls, about how science really works and people can really watch it unfold in front of them.
Pamela: One of the other things that is kind of awesome is the shows that are either speculative fiction or science fiction that incorporates science realistically are often, not always, but often more successful. People are forever panning Armageddon because it had really bad science. Deep impact had its science somewhat better but gets ignored just because it wasn’t a great movie. Then you look at the modern wave of post-Armageddon on television right now. There is revolution, defiance and falling skies. Revolution has about the worst science of them and it’s the least critically acclaimed of them. It’s that scientific realism that you have falling skies in defiance that really adds something to the shows.
Fraser: Now is it just western culture that has a problem with this? Canada and the United States are very similar in this situation and I’m assuming that England and Australia are very similar as well. If you’re in Korea or Japan they take it pretty seriously right?
Pamela: Oh they take it very seriously. Especially in China where they see it and much of the developing world they see their intellectual students as people with the chance to better their society and their own lives. The phrase “tiger mom” is largely derogatory here in America and it refers to how Asian parents work so hard to see their children succeed. It bothers me at a certain level that parents who fight too hard to see their children succeed is something that is that harshly looked down upon. Yes, you can go way overboard in helping your children succeed, I see that.
Fraser: But the point being that the person that’s good in science in Korea or Japan or China…
Pamela: Grades are celebrated
Fraser: That’s not seen as a weird thing. Do you think maybe that’s where you get this situation where science has made such a difference and science has been so ingrained into the culture that you take it for granted and now suddenly you aren’t directly connected to the value that you’re getting from the science.
Pamela: I’m not sure where it is but one of the things that I want to find a sociologist to talk about is you see in countries like Finland where education is highly regarded. School teachers are highly paid, about the same as they pay their doctors. Here in the US that is not true. I’ve heard Brittany Schmidt who is an amazing researcher. She’s the one who figured out that hydraulics play a roll in the ice motion on Europa. She is a brilliant woman. I heard her talking about how here she is in her early 30’s and is so proud to finally be living in an apartment without roommates while she watches her friends from high school buy houses. The reason that she if finally now able to have an apartment without a roommate is because scientists are so poorly paid by in large. In academics, that’s not true in industry but in academics it is. When you have post-doctoral positions which is what most of us have for 12 years, I escaped that but most do, that often pay $40,000. You have starting faculty positions at universities that pay $30,000. That says something about how society values science.
Fraser: Do you think that the tide is shifting a little bit? I see things back 20 years ago and there was no reason to be into video games and comics books and science and all of these kinds of computers. For a lot of the mass majority there was no social value to be into those kinds of things. Things like roll playing games. I organized roll playing games clubs in my various school classes.
Pamela: I did D&D basic back in the day.
Fraser: Socially that was seen as weird but now everyone plays video games. Everyone has a computer. Everyone uses a smart phone. That’s considered normal.
Pamela: There are still those delineations where not everyone does World of Warcraft. That’s the new D&D. Not everyone does D&D still. I think the social games are still escued where as Pac Man and Donkey Kong was played by everyone. Everyone had an Atari it seemed like. It was the multi-user games that were always escued. It’s that weird “It’s okay for a jock to be totally into playing the arcade style games but not totally okay to play the World of Warcraft style games”.
Fraser: Now if I could grant you unlimited political power to effect policy in the US and Canada, what would you do to encourage an interest in science. One of these big risks and I think it’s an existential risk that a lot of people are worried about in the US is where you’ve got this situation where the US falls behind in terms of science to the rest of the world. What would you do if you had a few billion dollars, could affect policy and make changes, what would you do?
Pamela: A few billion…
Fraser: A few hundred billion… whatever you want. I’m opening up the US coffers to your disposal. What will you do to help and make science more of a priority in the US society.
Pamela: At the couple billion level I think what we really need is a society that is better able to understand how cool and awesome science can be. One of the best ways to do that, I hate saying this, is through robotics. You get kids learning how to program and build both on the software and hardware side of robotics to solve various problems. You get adults free maker space. If we had maker centers in every town and free courses that people can engage in so they can celebrate their own technical solutions. Low cost 3D printers. Introduce people to the power that comes from knowing how to do problem solving. Then on the other side of this, free up our ND budgets so that there is more money for innovation, there is more money to discover on the basic research side then on the applied research side. We don’t have significant money being spent on our ND rate now and that’s frankly terrifying. You have to engage people in the process. It’s not enough to simply teach facts and figures. You need them doing science and I think that the best and most effective way is often through robotics. Robotics can get tied in to astronomy and aerospace. There are programs to build artificial intelligence, sub-orbital gliders, there is the moon bots program with the Google lunar x prize to build robots that have capacity to rove over moon like surfaces. Then maker space is if we can get… imagine, if the way post WWII the way sons worked with their fathers on the car and fixing the television and everything else. That was such a powerful experience both for the family and for learning. Imagine if it became maker spaces where moms and dads took their children to build things for fun instead of sitting around watching movies on the sofa while playing on their smart phones.
Fraser: You really want a maker bot don’t you?
Pamela: I really do.
Fraser: I can tell. I want one too, that would be awesome. This is funny because I think you are always the grim realist and I’m the breathless optimist. I think you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. You can’t push a string. The tremendous accomplishments in science and technology in the US has given your culture so much of a head start and an advantage in the world economy that it’s only natural for people to be taking it for granted and that their coasting. I think that you’ve having this situation where… how to do you compare and contrast where most people turn their nose at science and they don’t really care, don’t understand how it works and they aren’t contributing to their taxes and so on. Then you look at a place like Japan, China or Korea… especially China, and they take it super seriously. It’s a life or death race to the top.
Pamela: I think putting Japan and China in the same boat is a very poor thing to do because they have completely different motivations. Japan is a first world nation. It is technologically far more advanced than we are. Going there suddenly I realized how little technology has infiltrated my life. China on the other hand is a nation that has great extremes across the country. America has that too but not to the same level. We do have issues in the Ozarks and issues in the Leeward island where there are communities that are really third world. They are small fractions of the nation. In China that’s turned on its head where you do have vast areas that are still very much developing and it’s in those areas that for a smart child they will give up anything including giving their child to a state-run schools in order to see that child be able to join this first world nation of the technologically elite. Japan is actually a really interesting example of a place that because of the smallness of the nation and the need to mechanize things and also because they have a very inverted population where they do have so many older people. They have had to turn to technology for things like reading books to children to providing companions for the elderly. It’s a country where robots are an answer. I wish we could emulate that.
Fraser: I wonder if it’s going to be a situation where the technology is going to to continue advancing and people will be more and more disconnected from people and they won’t understand and won’t be engaged with it. The people who are will become more and more specialized. You will become a warp field coil engineer and all you understand is warp field dynamics. It’s from the Star Trek universe.
Pamela: It’s interesting how we’re ending up in such a cliquey society. You and I live in circles where we consume science focused music, we read books from authors who take time to find PhD’s to advise them on science, we hang out with people who are solving some of the great software problems out there and developing amazing new hardware. We have self selected to live in this sub culture, counter culture, I don’t know, that is focused more on being fact based, living more science inspired realities. We are imbedded in cultures where that is not uniformly true. I ride horses and I’m seeing this rift between those of us who choose to live connected lives and those who rescue that as improper and unnecessary. I worry about the cultural biases about diving into technology and intellectualism are going to lead, at least in America, to the digital divide between those who are connected and those who are not growing stronger and stronger even though the cost of being connected is dropping. There is now digital access for almost anybody but you need to intellectually decide to be a connected person and accept that this is a source of information that can allow me to live a better life.
Fraser: Yeah and I feel that the changes that are happening in our society and our technology are happening so fast that I’m having trouble keeping on top of it. I’m constantly surprised and you and I do this to each other all the time. I’ll be like “Hey have you seen this thing yet?” and you’ll be like “No, this is the most useful thing that has ever been presented to me. This is going to change everything.” Then a week will go by and you’ll be like “Hey remember that thing you showed me last week well now I’m making it do this”. This is people who are constantly on the look out for it. Who are attempting to incorporate it into our lives as fast a possible and still I’m completely overwhelmed by this science and technology. I see people who are just disconnected from it and they are in many cases just slipping behind. Maybe the oldest is then on the technologist to make things more accessible, to make things here for people to use. That’s very specifically saying “Don’t worry about the science that’s going on here”.
Pamela: And that’s not the answer we need to teach people. The problem solving skills. I had a rant with one of my staff earlier today because he and I live on the cutting edge of technology and we have to figure every bloody thing out for ourselves; I know you’re in the same boat. Then we turn around and we have people asking us “I need you to explain this to me”, then getting very… like we’re morally required to explain all of the… huh?
Fraser: No I know but you can’t expect everybody to dive in as deep as we like to go with this technology and with the science. It’s funny, I experience this with my kids by teaching them to be skeptics and rational thinkers as just a baseline. Where they go with that doesn’t really matter but I’m…
Pamela: You didn’t say it but you’re teaching them problem solving too which is a third step to it.
Fraser: I watched Man of Steel just yesterday and we loved it but there was a ton of product placement in it. It was very subtle. It included product placement for LexCorp which is awesome. There is a point where someone gets smashed through a 7 11 and my son goes “Product placement”. There is this kind of skepticism and rational thinking that is going on all the time. If we could just get people to learn those skills…
Pamela: I really think that problem solving plays just as much as a part of it. I know you hand you or I a new piece of technology and we start figuring out on our own how to use it. You or I break something and we can’t always fix it but we can always figure out what direction we broke it. That ability to look at your reality and see how pieces fit together and how to problem solve solutions to basic problems to figure out how to problem solve how to use a new piece of software, to ask questions to figure out how to engage in new situations. That is an additional skill that comes out of the basic scientific method. You have hypothesis, you test, you figure out if it’s right and that I think is just as necessary. I imagine all the hours people are going to waste if they wait for someone like you or I to teach them how to use a Google Hangout. Just do it. JUST DO IT.
Fraser: Just do it till you break it. Again I’ve taught my kids that 90% of their troubleshooting issues have gone away because it’s like “Did you restart it? Did you reboot it? Did you retry it? Have you reinstalled it? Now Google it because that’s what I would do.” Maybe that’s it. Maybe that’s the heart of it that if we could somehow give future generations time to just really learn and internalize the scientific method and use that to study their lives around them that that would become a tool set that they could use the rest of their life. If everything they could see they could bring into the filter of the scientific method.
Pamela: Right. Learn, understand and imagine how different television would be if you got to watch people learn how to solve their problems instead of always waiting for people to solve their problems.
Fraser: Cool well this is great. Thank you very much Pamela.
Pamela: It’s been my pleasure.

Comments on “The smart Trick of tampa security systems That No One is Discussing”Press Release
Greendale, WI, Jan. 14, 2013 — Greendale Against Bullying (GAB Now), is pleased to announce that we have entered into a partnership with Milwaukee Public Schools and the Greendale School District in order to help prevent and effectively combat bullying within the school districts.
GABNow is a unique community-based, non-profit, student-advocacy group that has formed in response to the recent high-profile incidents of bullying in our community and across the country. GABnow is comprised of residents from all walks of life who care about the emotional and physical health of our students. Taking a
PROACTIVE approach to combating and preventing bullying will help to eliminate the old attitudes that bullying is acceptable. Together with our children, parents, students, administrators, educators, local law enforcement, businesses and community organizations we will help educate, prevent and provide the tools necessary to stop bullying. Awareness and education are key elements to helping our children find these solutions
GABnow will be an alternative source for students and parents to seek help in cases of suspected bullying. President Linda Lee said, “Having a working partnership with the school districts will help our organization, the schools and the community as a whole. Working together will have a direct and positive impact in addressing the issue of bullying.”
GABnow’s first public event: GAB has reserved March 20, the auditorium at the Greendale High School a showing of the Lee Hirsch Documentary, “Bully”. The doors open at 6:00pm and the showing starts at 7:00pm.
For more information please follow us on Facebook or see our website. The GAB mission is to provide resources with clear-cut channels for our children and residents to reach out and stop bullying. GAB’s will provide a hands-on, comprehensive and proactive approach in helping our children understand our differences so they can interact with each other with acceptance, respect and compassion.
Lind Lee, President

Celebrity figures are often perceived as being vapid. Especially if their talent is mostly image-related. On her site, Hilton writes that she's "an expert at attracting attention," a professional skill in her industry. If the celebrity then is known to love pink, bling and is a platinum blonde, her perfumes are probably going to smell pink and vapid too...
After reading a series of public Internet confessionals issued about how Paris Hilton Eau de Parfum aces it as a fragrance for some who are not Hilton devotees, I was reminded of my own instant-like moment for a Paris Hilton fragrance at Target. Which one was it already? I couldn't remember as I was quickly urged to put back the fragrance on its shelf, lest my personal reputation might get tainted by it. I just remembered it was coded pink. Paris Hilton EDP or Heiress were my guesses - it was Heiress.
Heiress by Paris Hilton is an unlikely favorite perfume for me too, just like Paris Hilton EDP is to some others. But it just smells particularly and quite simply very good. It's got great sillage and diffusion.
The fragrance starts with an oderdose of fruit platter served on a vinyl tablecloth made of ethyl maltol and vanilla and while this sounds terrible in principle, the scent reveals a sure sense of restraint and subtltety in the midst of a firework display of bad taste. It smells a bit like a David LaChapelle picture looks, which I love.
From the superficially kitsch introduction follows the more durable impression that the fragrance composition by perfumer Steve de Mercado of Fragrance Resources is greatly balanced with discreet touches of sophistication here and there expressing unmistakable ladylike demeanor. You even discover an old-school flavor to it thanks to the secret use of a star anise note (llicium verum) which as a cook I am guessing must be part of many a vintage, oakmoss-rich formulae. Each time, I have an opportunity to inhale the sculptural glistening and matte rowel-shaped spice, it smells of an old Germaine Cellier oakmoss base.
As Heiress soon reveals, its vision is not just a dream of a strawberry shortcake and pear compote. The Eau de Parfum becomes delectably decadent in a desirable manner. This means that it smells of visually repulsive things like rotten peaches, banana popsicle melted to death in its own puddle - and even of lashings of creamy Durian pulp exhausted by the summer heat. Add to the mix some dainty powder for the nose. It is a mess but a seductive tropical mess. The star aniseed is a life saver.
In the novel Les mystères de Paris by Eugène Süe, there is at one point the description of a mythical very poor man's dish made up of all the remnants of the day served at a particular inn of underground Paris. In it, are thrown every scraps that have been left on the plates by all the already impoverished patrons earlier in the day. Working down the food chain, that dish is meant for the poorest of the poor becoming fabulous in its capacity to symbolize trashed humanity.
To some extent, Heiress is like that. It is literally a cheap mess of fruits with Chantilly and not from or for Eton, but from Malibu and for malls. It smells awefully strong of Banana Split and Champagne dabbed on earlobes, and yet it's an interesting and winsome spicy fruity-floral at the same time with a touch of old-school chypré glamour and money - like a 17th generation descendant of Mitsouko by Guerlain - of course, it's called Heiress for a reason. I go back to David La Chapelle to stress that here you have that same kind of outrageous neon motifs mixed with a sense of balance and classicism. It works and it smells great.
Fragrance notes:.The Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce is promoting the upcoming Atlantic Beach Bikefest with an unusual message targeting the Memorial Day weekend attendees: have a good time, just don’t break the law.
The three-minute video titled “Know Before you Go” is targeted at bikers to inform them of the increased presence of uniformed and plain-clothes police officers, and to encourage attendees to work with law enforcement to keep everyone safe.
“It’s not the typical Chamber of Commerce message,” says Brad Dean, chamber president.
Multiple shootings during the 2014 event that left three people dead and six others wounded prompted the chamber to release a similar video ad last year urging participants to follow the law, which met with mixed reactions, Dean said.
Never miss a local story.
“Critics said we were trying to scare people off, but we wanted to make clear we welcome everyone who respects the community and follows the law. If you’re not interested, we’d just as soon you go somewhere else,” Dean said.
“That doesn’t make the tourism textbook 101 campaign,” Dean said.
The video features several law enforcement officials from the Myrtle Beach Police Department, as well as Saundra Rhodes, who was still serving as Horry County Police Chief when the video was produced. Rhodes retired last month, and the video was later edited to identify her as the former police chief.
Critics said we were trying to scare people off, but we wanted to make clear we welcome everyone who respects the community and follows the law.
Brad Dean, president, Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce
Rhodes did not directly address the multiple shootings in 2014, but said “in past years there have been some challenges which have compromised fun and safety for all.”
“To those who plan to visit our community and respect our laws, we welcome you and we want you to have a fun and safe experience,” Rhodes said. “Unfortunately, it only takes a few problems to create an unsafe environment for others.”
The video explains the 23-mile traffic loop that will be in effect during the May 27-29 event, from 10 p.m. through 2 a.m., which is aimed at alleviating traffic on Ocean Boulevard and Kings Highway.
The “Know Before You Go” promotional webpage also advises that 42 license plate readers will be activated throughout Myrtle Beach along with mobile surveillance towers. Noise ordinances will be in force, as well as curfews for everyone younger than 18.
Consumption of alcoholic beverages are illegal in parking areas, and loitering is not permitted.
The Myrtle Beach Police arrested more than 800 people during the 2015 event, which was nearly 300 less than in 2014.

Today was a three bend day.
It started with the swing contest at Midsummer Night Swing. This was a contest that combined east coast swing, west coast swing, and lindy hop. As well as amateurs and professionals, and one jack and jill couple. Plus, this was the only contest I have ever attended where the contestants were judged by a licensed dermatologist (the contest was sponsored by Vaseline Intensive Care).
The second bend was an Odissi dance performance at SummerStage by the Nrityagram Ensemble (See also Rajika Puri's review). This was some of the most phenomenal dance I have seen, regardless of style. I know I have never seen more perfect stillness. So perfect, that the still dancer could upstage the moving dancer, even if this was not her intent. The Nrityagram Ensemble was masterful at any speed. The choreography was consistently interesting. Passion without narrative. I am sure they would describe their work as traditional dance, but to my eye they represent the best of modern dance. They claim that their dance represents and is inspired by the stone statues in the temples of east India (which are carved in distinctive three bend poses), but I think such an assertion is utter nonsense. It is more likely that the stone was inspired by their dance. True, this requires art to live backwards in time, but for some this is a normal condition. Merlin, for instance. The carving of stone is inherently an act of living backwards in time.
After this almost indescribable performance, I wandered west back through the park at night and was drawn to Tavern on the Green. It may have been almost 11 pm, but I found a raging party going on. A floor full of swing.
Competitive dance, performance dance, social dance. All outdoors. All on the same night. A three bend night indeed.Bench

Michael Boggs of Brooke & Boggs spoke to LTTM about their 'Wildfire' album, and how the duo came together to produce music for the church community.
Tell us a little bit about this new album of yours?
I asked a friend of mine who the best worship leader in Nashville was. He said Brooke Voland. I had never heard of her before, but when I finally got a chance to see her lead, I knew my friend was right. I asked her to lead with our team at Kairos one night and she graciously accepted. I felt like that night I knew something was different about leading with her. After a few months of leading together, our families began to pray about the possibility of us partnering together in ministry. Then, a few months later, we were recording our next EP. Since we’re both worship leaders at our own churches and desire to lead people to worship, we began writing and recording corporate worship songs, which eventually led us to the title, Wildfire as the name of our EP. In the Message’s paraphrase of Acts 2 it says that "the Spirit spread among the people like wildfire." Brooke and I have been praying that for our churches, homes and families. It’s not just the title of the EP, but it’s the center piece of most of our prayers.
Which is your favourite track on the album and why?
I have 2 favorites! I’m excited about “Grace Upon Grace.” It comes from John 1:16 that says "out of his fullness we have all received grace upon grace." Sometimes I think that I had done something just outside of God’s grace and there isn’t enough to cover my mistakes, but the reality is that no matter what we’ve done, God’s grace is greater than our sins.
“The Cross Stands” is another song we are excited about. We’ve had the opportunity to lead this song and were reminded of how much we need to be reminded of this truth. The Cross was a place of unspeakable tragedy, brutal death and unfathomable pain, but God brought life out of that mess and extended that same life to us. The cross stands over our guilt, shame, mistakes and faults.
Does this music sound and feel different to the stuff you did with FFH?
I think our music is definitely aimed at corporate worship for the church. FFH wrote songs we’d sing to people, Brooke and I are trying to write songs we sing with people.
If you could work with any songwriter, who would it be and why?
Fortunately, because I live in Nashville, I’ve been able to write with many of my heroes. However, one person that I’ve yet to write with that I would love the opportunity is Jason Ingram. He’s unbelievably talented and I’m grateful that he is writing songs for the church to sing.
Do you prefer playing live or working in the studio?
I like both. In the studio you need to be creative and help imagine what your music is going to sound like. When you’re playing live, you’re trying to execute what you’ve already created. Both are challenging and both are rewarding.
How would you describe your style of music and what are your influences?
I think singer-songwriter-worship-leaders is the best way to describe it. Although, I’m not sure that's a genre. Ha. I was influenced by church music growing up. Also my dad and mom played and sang together and most of my early years were spent listening to them sing together.
How would you define success in your career?
Obedience to what God was telling/asking me to do.
What is your favorite album of all time?
That’s such a hard question but the one album that most likely has the most plays would be Rich Mullins Greatest Hits.
You're stuck on an island, it's hot, you only have enough battery life left to listen to one song on your mp3 player. What track is it?
A brand new song from one of my favorite writers. Oh, and it has to be just an acoustic/vocal work tape version.
What does the next year hold for Brooke & Boggs?
We are traveling some together this year but in short, we’ve promised to take the next step, whatever that means and wherever that goes. We’re just trying to be obedient, putting one foot in front of the other.TOTOODO is a Xiaomi service Center company offering efficient service solutions for all branded smart phones, tablets and laptops.

The flats, to be built under the government's 'Jahan Jhuggi Wahan Makan' (houses in place of slums) scheme, will come up a few metres from a slum at Rana Pratap Bagh in south Delhi's Sangam Park area. According to an official, the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) will build the flats, which will be ready in the next two-three years. Once the flats were ready, the slum-dwellers would be shifted there, he said. In February, DUSIB had approved a proposal to construct 6,178 flats for the economically weaker section at Lajpat Nagar, Bhalaswa, Dev Nagar, Mangolpuri and Ambedkar Nagar.

well crafted weapons to take down the top foe, Resistance! the “little guy” on your shoulder.
..:Recommended:..
Love Pressfields previous books and whilst this is short it's straight to the point and not only motivates you, but makes yiu realise the small. Things and thoughts that often question your logic, make you procrastnate or just stall you from stalling, doing and knowing what's next..... Will. Keep on phone as a reminder!
I owe a debt of gratitude to the author for articulating what goes on in my mind when working on new projects! Read it!
Pressfield doesn't mince his words - he sears them quickly over a blowtorch and lays them, charred and bloody on your plate.
If you want to think about doing something, read someone else. If you want to actually achieve something, read Pressfield.!
Always inspirational, Steven Pressfield is one of those writers where you know no matter what it is you are going to take away something that will change your life. This is no different, I would recommend it to everyone.
This is a simple straight forward book.
I valued the open approach that Steven takes with his work and the vulnerability he displays in admitting his own mistakes.
The ideas and learnings I found were valuable. I recommend this book.
Try it!!
I have returned to this book again and been delightfully reminded that the effort to make change is huge but worth it. No one that attempts anything worthwhile achieved it without the constant battle between that which you want to bring to the world and the internal resistance to stay small.
Short and to the point - the kick in the ass every creative needs every now and again.
Loved it. The narration was good. The concepts are easy to understand with examples. I would love to read more from this author..

Updated on 2011-05-12 by Andrew FountainIt was a record attendance at Ashton Court on Saturday, with 307 attending, beating the previous best of 304. Twenty four attended from Bristol & West. What was also significant was that this Parkrun was probably run in the hottest conditions since the Ashton Court parkrun started over two years ago.
There were four PBs this week, from Louis Day, Ruth Bush, Barry Mills and Alan Graves. The Performance of the Week went to Alan Graves who was also first in the VM70-74 category. The club’s best Age Grade run, once again went to Pete Mountain with a score of 80.66%. Pete was only three seconds off his PB.
Congratulations to Carron Downer who completed his fiftieth Parkrun on Saturday.

Ford has put 20 plug-in hybrid Transit Custom vans on the streets of London as part of its multi-million-pound initiative to reduce air pollution in the capital.
The vans have bent given to a selection of commercial fleets who will use them for 12 months in a bid to discover whether hybrid vehicles can help achieve cleaner air targets.
Ford says that commercial vehicles in the capital make a combined total of 280,000 trips every day, with eight million miles travelled. The Blue Oval claims the plug-in hybrid Transits will reduce emissions by running purely on electricity for most of the journeys.
Ford has also said that it is the first volume commercial vehicle manufacturer to offer plug-in hybrid technology on its vans.
“This exciting project in London shows how innovative technology can help improve the prosperity and quality of life in our congested cities,” said Jim Farley, chairman and CEO of Ford of Europe. “Ford is the top-selling commercial vehicle brand in Europe, so it’s fitting that this Transit plug-in hybrid is leading the electric vehicle revolution for business users.”
The hybrid Transit Custom is just one of 13 electrified vehicles Ford will build over the next five years. The manufacturer has already confirmed hybrid versions of the Mustang and F-150 will be made for the USA, as well as an all-electric SUV.

Heritage Centre:Passive immunotherapy rapidly increases structural plasticity in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease
Neurobiol Dis. 2009 Feb;33(2):213-20. Epub 2008 Nov 6.
Senile plaque-associated changes in neuronal connectivity such as altered neurite trajectory, dystrophic swellings, and synapse and dendritic spine loss are thought to contribute to cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and mouse models. Immunotherapy to remove amyloid beta is a promising therapy that causes recovery of neurite trajectory and dystrophic neurites over a period of days. The acute effects of immunotherapy on neurite morphology at a time point when soluble amyloid has been cleared but dense plaques are not yet affected are unknown. To examine whether removal of soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) has a therapeutic effect on dendritic spines, we explored spine dynamics within 1 h of applying a neutralizing anti Abeta antibody. This acute treatment caused a small but significant increase in dendritic spine formation in PDAPP brain far from plaques, without affecting spine plasticity near plaques or average dendritic spine density. These data support the hypothesis that removing toxic soluble forms of amyloid-beta rapidly increases structural plasticity possibly allowing functional recovery of neural circuits.How it Works

It's funny how we don't appreciate meet ups back home when we are in the same place and being able to have the convenience to travel to meet up easily. I think it's true that we only appreciate things which is difficult to achieve - perhaps this is the human nature.
Lately, I have been catching up with friends from highschool. We talked about how much how our lives have changed from highschool and the hardships we have been through to get where we are. Those hardships may not be as big as you've imagined but it pulls all of us through a battlefield to where we are now. We realized that we are all survivors from them and not a victim. I never agree to name ourselves victim when we have pull it through - no matter it was a bad relationship, dramatic friendship and things that makes you feel like a failure in life.
From the conversations and catching up, I am so glad that all of us got better now. We improved from where we are and learned from our mistakes. All of us learned to understand that time doesn't wait and all things will pass. We start to appreciate the luxury we have right now compare to other people who may not have the chance of what we are having. I love how everyone I know grew to be grateful and blessed.
" So, what do you exactly want to be in the future?"
I get that question a lot. I will answer what I want to do for a living, basically my career in future. Then I thought of it again - if that is what I really want to be.
But lately, I found my answer to that question. I finally know what I want -
" I want to be better than who I am yesterday."Microsoft.

United have not won in any competition since they beat Watford last month. Since they have critically drawn against PSV Eindhoven and lost to Wolfsburg to shatter their Champions League ambitions and two Premier League draws against Leicester and West Ham plus the awful defeat at Bournemouth on Saturday has undermined hopes of a strong title challenge.
It has been a damaging eight days.
“It’s been a tough one to take, very disappointing week,” says midfielder Carrick. “Going out of the Champions League was obviously tough to take and we were very disappointed.
"And then to come to Bournemouth, we wanted to bounce back and we tried to bounce back and to fall short like we have is doubly disappointing.
In pictures: Bournemouth v United
.
“But I don’t like making excuses, we’ve got the squad, we’re the club that we are because we want to be fighting in the competitions, when you’ve got injuries you’ve got to deal with them so I’m not making excuses.
“We need to get back to winning games..”
The 2-1 Bournemouth loss came on top of the Reds losing their status among Europe's elite in the Champions League.
“We’re professional players, we want to be playing at the top level, we want to be testing ourselves at the top level. To be out of the Champions League is a big blow for us – you can’t deny that. That’s there, that’s obvious for everyone to see,” the 34-year-old added.

Neighborhood Nostalgia on a Frosty Day
About the same time yesterday that two of my brothers, visiting from Montana and Oregon, were driving around on an afternoon memory-lane adventure, I was headed home from completing some errands in town.
After driving past the old University of Idaho experiment farm on my way in to town and having observed a truly magical blend of frosty trees, bushes and frozen ponds, I decided to stop there on the way home.
I pulled into the parking area on the North Boyer farm, which once grew lush fields of alfalfa and other experimental crops. Now, the acreage includes open areas of flat ground and gently rolling hills, providing recreationalists a convenient spot to enjoy throughout the seasons.
Back in the day, when we were living at our farm less than a mile away, Tom Brackney ran the experiment station with help from Charlie Johnson, a longtime, close friend and hunting buddy of our dad Harold.
Tom's family lived in the house near what's now Panhandle Special Needs, and because his daughter Kathleen was one of my classmates at Lincoln School, I spent a lot of time at their house. My most vivid memories: dialing (not cranking) the Brackney's new-fangled wall phone for the first time, enjoying a piece of Mrs. Brackney's mayonnaise cake and playing croquet with Kathleen and her sisters in their back yard.
So, it was a bit of memory lane for me as I got out of the car, snapped a couple of photos and then walked toward a friendly couple who had been cross country skiing.
I visited with David and Nicole for a few minutes and proudly answered David's question, "Are you from around here?" with "All my life . . . grew up just a mile away on a farm north of the airport."
David helps maintain the cross country ski trails when he's not doing his day job as a financial consultant, while Nicole sells planks for grilling. The more we talked the more people we knew in common.
That's what's always fun about Sandpoint.
Anyway, while Nicole went on her way and David took another ski run, I walked around like a kid in a candy store, marveling at the winter beauty while taking pictures. At times, I just plain smiled, thinking about how pretty virtually every view was AT THAT MOMENT.
Could be most folks have rarely seen the place look quite like this---my timing was right because except for David who was cruising the trails, once again, as so often happens on my frequent photo adventures, I had the place to myself.
That's always fun about Sandpoint too.
I drove home, thrilled with the experience and soon sharing it with my brothers who had stopped by the house from their afternoon adventures.
Then, the tales began. We're all sad that virtually no vestige of our early years on that North Boyer farm exists except for the acreage itself. The last of its character and our visible memories went with a logging job last year.
Nonetheless, those memories are nicely tucked away in our minds.
Kevin told of his tree house and of the red flag he placed at the top of a tree in the woods. He didn't think Harold ever saw that, but did remember distinctly our dad's reaction when he discovered that the extensive line of dozens of pieces of twine neatly tied together and extending between a pine tree in the west field and a cottonwood at the field's edge.
Kevin told Jim and me that his goal of stringing all that twine across the field was to be able to talk from one tree to another. I don't know if he ever did.
We also remembered snowmobiling in the field dotted with stump piles. Harold had cleared that field, and the piles remained for years.
The highlight of our snowmobiling memories could have had a bad ending, but our sister Barbara was pretty lucky that the machine stopped with her aboard before it went out of control through the north barbwire fence.
Of course, I had to bring up the mail thefts and the curiosity over the years of any possible existence of the remnants of the mail I had stolen at the youthful age of 5 from twelve mailboxes and buried beneath the pine needles in the northeast corner of our woods.
Jim reminisced about the rocket launches after Harold hauled the 4-H rocketry club members out to the southwest field on a wagon so they could test their homemade models. There were Gissels and Bergers among that bunch.
Great memories of formative times in our lives on that beloved farm. And, so wonderful to revive them every now and then.
So, yes, the trip to the old experiment farm inspired a few thoughts of the past for me along with a lot of visual enjoyment. And, then after telling my new friend Dave about that farm not far away, I really enjoyed the later experience of bringing some portions of it back to life with some of my siblings.
Can't beat that!
Happy Friday. Safe travels for Willie and Debbie as they go to Boise, for Annie as she flies into Spokane this afternoon and for everyone who's coming or going.Laporan DESRIANDI CANDRA, Teluk Kuantan [email protected]
Calon Pegawai Negeri Sipil (CPNS/CASN) dari kalangan pelamar umum yang direkrut Pemkab Kuansing 2009 lalu di-PTUN-kan oleh LSM Permata Kuansing. Salah satu tuntutannya meminta Pemkab mencatat SK pengangkatan CPNS/CASN
Senin (18/1) kemarin, digelar sidang gugatan pendahuluan di PTUN Pekanbaru. Persidangan itu menghadirkan Kepala Badan Kepegawaian Daerah (BKD) Kuansing Drs Muharman MPd. ??Ini baru sidang pendahuluan saja. Sidang akan dilanjutkan pekan depan,?? kata Muharnis MS SH selaku tim Pengacara Pemkab Kuansing kepada Riau Pos, Kamis (21/1) di kantor bupati.
Persoalan perekrutan CPNS/CASN dari kalangan pelamar umum 2009 lalu memang sempat menjadi topik pembicaraan utama di tengah masyarakat Kabupaten Kuansing. Pasalnya, mereka menilai, perekrutan CPNS/CASN di lingkungan Pemkab Kuansing tersebut ditemukan banyak keganjilan yang mencurigakan.
Nilai yang diraih peserta yang lulus dengan yang tidak lulus berbeda dari data yang dimiliki BKD Kuansing dengan data kelulusan yang dipublikasikan Lembaga Managemen Fakultas Ekonomi Universitas Indonesia (LMFEUI) yang diumumkan dalam situs resminya via internet, sehari setelah Pemkab Kuansing mengumumkannya.
Namun beberapakali pula, Pemkab Kuansing melalui BKD menerangkannya kepada publik. Kepala BKD Kuansing Drs Muharman MPd yang ditemui Riau Pos di kantor bupati secara terpisah, tidak menapik adanya sidang gugatan yang diajukan sebuah lembaga swadaya masyarakat Kuansing tersebut ke PTUN Pekanbaru terkait perekrutan CPNS/CASN di lingkungan Pemkab Kuansing 2009. ??Memang ada masuk gugatan ke PTUN Pekanbaru. Ini hal yang biasa,?? kata Muharman.
Dalam gugatan yang dilayangkan lembaga swadaya masyarakat tersebut, lanjut Muharman, tidak terlihat subtansi yang digugat. Namun salah satu yang menjadi gugatannya ke PTUN adalah pembatalan SK Bupati Kuansing tentang CPNS/CASN tersebut. ??Inikan baru sidang pendahuluan, dan proses pengangkatan CPNS/CASN tetap berlanjut. Tapi kalau majelis hakim memenangkan mereka nanti akan dilakukan perubahan,?? ujarnya.
BKD, kata Muharman, sesuai dengan prosedur telah mengumumkan data kelulusan CPNS/CASN yang mereka terima dari LMFEUI selaku pemeriksa kelulusan CPNS/CASN. ??Sehingga, kalau pun ada gugatan tersebut, sebetulnya dialamatkan ke LMFEUI tersebut. Karena data yang diumumkan tersebut, diterima dari mereka,?? ujarnya.
Pemkab menggunakan UI sebagai lembaga independen pemeriksa kelulusan, untuk menggunakan standar kelulusan yang menjadi tolok ukur. Padahal, penentuan kelulusan sebetulnya tetap menjadi kewenangan daerah. ??Tetapi karena kita tidak memiliki standar kelulusan, kita gunakan UI,?? terangnya.
Persoalan CPNS/CASN 2009 ini tetap berjalan. Saat ini, Pemkab melalui BKD sudah mengusulkan ke BKN untuk pengangkatan dan NIP CPNS/CASN. Masa PNS/ASN mereka, akan Terhitung Mulai Tanggal (TMT) per Februari 2010. Namun SK PNS/ASN mereka baru akan dibagikan awal Maret 2010 mendatang.(nto)

Patient Partcipation Direct Enhanced Service
Hucknall Road Medical Centre annualy partakes in a Direct Enhanced Service (DES) called the Patient Participation DES.
The purpose of the Patient Participation DES is to ensure that patients are involved in decisions about the range and quality of services provided and, over time, commissioned by their practice.
Hucknall Road Medical Centre had already established a Patient Participation Group (PPG) prior to the DES being introduced and therefore had already carried out some of the required elements.
Further to this, we needed to establish areas of priority with the PPG and conduct a practice survey focusing on the priority areas to collate a wide range of patient views which was carried out in Feb 2014.
We then discussed the survey results and key findings with the PPG and discussed areas in which the PPG felt the practice could improve upon. We have since then developed an action plan which can be viewed in the above link.

He is assigned to do their weekly and monthly report, thus making him as the official photographer sometimes. He needed to take pictures of their workloads as part of his report.
When he makes his reports, I can’t help but glance at the photos he took. He has pictures of big metal pipes, industrial hand wheels, people who are working and many more. He makes sure every work load is documented via photos and logbook. He is dedicated with his job.
Anyway, I decided to save up for a point-and-shoot camera for myself and give him our old digital camera because we share one old digicam. As you can see, I don’t want him to miss taking pictures for his reports just as l don’t want to miss the milestones of our children. So, I think it would be better we will have separate cameras to pursue our causes in life. That would be great right?

"At-Home Resources for Managing IPF"
"Exhale: Mindfully Manage your IPF is an online program developed by Genentech and partners, including AACVPR, to provide resources to help people with Idopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) take a proactive role in their care. The program features mindfulness videos developed in collaboration with AACVPR, the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation (PFF), and respiratory healthcare professionals, including clinical psychologist and internationally recognized expert in mindfulness Dr. Shauna Shapira.
IPF is an irreversible and unprdictable disease that makes breathing difficult and causes permanent scarring damage to the lungs. We know that people with IPF often experience feelings of anxiety, frustration, and isoluation. Research shows mindfulnesss can help people living with chornic illnesses, like IPF, manage these types of emotions.

Nigeria News Comments are Moderated. Clean Comments will be swiftly approved. No swear words, no racism, allowed.Ali Campbell left UB40 in 2008. He was later joined by Astro and Mickey. They all got together in 2014 to release ‘Silhouette’ under Ali’s moniker, ‘The Legendary voice of UB40 reunited with Astro and Mickey.’ As has happened other bands, legal reasons has prevented them using the original band name so “UB40 featuring..’ is the trios way out of this.
As well as featuring covers, this ‘Unplugged’ album is the first time that UB40’s catalogue has been stripped back and given the acoustic treatment. The collection opens with ‘Kingston Town’ which features a beautiful Hawaiian sounding acoustic guitar while Ali’s vocals are awash with reverb.
The tracks we expect to hear from UB40 are there, ‘Red Red Wine’ with a new talk/rap over it, ‘I Can’t Help Falling in Love’ and ‘I Got You Babe’ which features Ali’s daughter, Kaya Campbell on vocals. Sidebar: She’s got a great tone to her voice.
Pato Banton also makes an appearance on ‘Come Back’. This version of the track has the tempo slowed, which is this album’s greatest downfall. Many of the tracks are too similar in tempo which could easily lead it to fall into background music territory. I just want Pato to get that 1994 original tempo going. This crosses over to ‘Purple Rain’, here, it’s reggae tempo is speeded up.
That’s not saying it’s a bad album. One of the standouts, the trio’s version of ‘Many Rivers to Cross’ features great musical arrangements. Perhaps, with the re-workings the problem is that we are too accustomed to the original versions.
This makes the decision to include a second disc of all the original UB40 versions slightly baffling. But, with all legal things in the music industry, this may have been part of a deal to use the ‘UB40 featuring’ name. It could also be something to do with another ‘Essential UB40’ album being released earlier this year.
Back to Disc 1, the ‘Unplugged’ side of things. It’s not a bad collection, though it continues at a steady pace without many hills and troughs. It would be perfect for a long hot day in Summer, with a barbecue going in the garden. There are places where the arrangements flirt with genius, like the drum and bass-esque opening for ‘One in Ten’. I’d love to see this revisited for a full DnB treatment. ‘Rat in Mi Kitchen’ a la 2016 is refreshing and when stripped down could be rebuilt for 2016’s EDM world.
No doubt, Ali Campbell’s reggae delivers what the UB40 fanbase will love. What they really need is some new material under the ‘UB40 feat’ moniker. I just wish that they hadn’t touched Purple Rain.

Three Methods:Getting Betting InformationChoosing a HorsePlacing a WagerCommunity Q&A!
Steps
1
Getting Betting Information
- 1Purchase.
- 2Buy a Daily Racing Form to read about past performances. Daily Racing Forms (DRFs) are produced by the racetrack to offer more information about the day’s contestants. Purchase a DRF at the betting counter, which will provide you with records of past performances as well as handicapping. DRFs normally cost about $4 USD.[2]
- Daily racing forms also include detailed articles about horse racing.
- DRFs are produced daily, and are written specifically about the day's contestants.
- 3Check a local newspaper for handicapper selections. Some newspapers cover events at the local racetrack. Check a local newspaper for handicappers’ selections, which are sometimes published. Professional handicappers analyze the odds of a race to produce predictions about the outcome.[3]
- Alternatively, racetracks often sell handicapping tips sheets for about $2 USD.
2
Choosing a Horse
- 1Look at the horse’s odds of winning. Look at the estimated odds of each horse winning the race. This will appear as a large number printed next to the horse’s stats. Check out the horses’ race records for a better indication of their winning ability.[4]
- For instance, good odds for a horse might be 3-1 while long odds could be closer to 15-1. That means that the first horse has a 25% chance of winning, while the other horse only has a 6.25% chance.
- If you bet $2 USD on a horse with 3-1 odds, you will win $8 USD. If you bet the same amount of a horse with 15-1 odds, you will win $32 USD.
- 2View.[5]
- 3Check.
- 4Keep. Alternatively, visit the track from time to time without betting to see how the horses are performing.[6]
- 5Look up racehorse pedigree information. A horse’s genetic background may suggest that they’ve inherited a winning characteristic, such as speed. Look up handicapping charts and pedigree information online to see if a racehorse is descended from other winning horses. A strong pedigree is a telling indicator of a horse’s performance.[7]
3
Placing a Wager
- 1Set a betting budget.]
- 2Place your bet at the betting window if you are at a racetrack. Go to the betting window and tell the clerk the number of the race you’re betting on. Tell them how much you are betting, the type of wager, and the number of the horse as it is listed in the program. Be sure to check your betting ticket before leaving the window to correct any mistakes that might be on it.[9]
- Automatic tellers are also available at some racetracks.
- 3Place a bet online if you want to bet from home.]
- 4
- 5Bet on your horse “placing” or “showing.” Place a bet on your horse “placing” (i.e., either winning or coming in second), which will increase your odds of winning. The payout will be less, but the risk of losing is also smaller. To make the bet even safer, bet on your horse “showing,” which means you will get a payout if it comes in first, second, or third.[12]
- 6Place an “across the board” bet.]
- 7Make an exotic wager. Unlike “straight” wagers, “exotic” wagers involve multiple horses and very specific situations. These bets are often 3 or 4 times more expensive than simple bets and have lower odds, but hold the potential for a larger payout if you win. Choose your bet carefully and only go through with it if you have enough cash to handle a likely loss. Some examples of “exotic” bets are:[14]
- A “quinella” bet, where your horses must finish first and second, in any order. This is the simplest “exotic” bet to place.
- An “exacta” bet, where your horses must finish first and second in the specific order you choose.
-. This is essentially a “daily double” plus another didn't cash in my tickets - how can I find out if they are good or not?wikiHow ContributorUsually tickets expire after 12 months. Credits don't expire. You can look up race results online, or go back to track to find out and/or cash them in.
- Can I make a $5 bet?wikiHow ContributorIt depends on where you go, every facility will have its own minimum betting requirement.
- How much do I get if I win?wikiHow ContributorYou get your money back, and double the amount. For example, if you bet $100, you will turn in your money, and if you lose, you will not get it back, so you just paid $100. If you win, you get you $100 back, and $100 extra..
Tips
- At the end of the day, take all of your vouchers to the cashier to receive your winnings in cash.
- Plan on arriving at least half an hour before the race you want to bet on to familiarize yourself with the track.
Warnings
- Gambling can sometimes become an addiction and negatively affect your life. If necessary, seek help in dealing with this addiction.

One can see this when switching from 8 to 4 bit (or 2). PMView sometimes reduces the number of colors according to internal tables (it says 6-bit for example).
But: I didn't ever get the hang of willingly reducing the number of colors - say: from 254 or such to say 137 which may preserve an acceptable quality but reduces the needed size to a minimum.
It is doable: one might edit the colors within the palette editor to equal values - PMView will correct the numbers after loading the palette again.
I think that this process could be "automized" and the "quantizing" of colors could be done by algorithms that might well be implemented in the code.

Regards,
AndreasAccording to most published reports, the National Basketball Association is expected to announce sometime next week that Dirk Nowitzki will be the 06/07 Most Valuable Player. Really? The case for Nowitzki in the minds of those who voted for him is simple: the Mavericks won a NBA best 67 games, and Dirk was the leading scorer and rebounder on that team. Presumably, a vote for Nowitzki meant that that voter subscribes to the belief that the best player on the best team is deserving of the award. However, I feel that this logic is unfounded. Allow me to break down some of many reasons why Dirk Nowitzki is not an MVP caliber talent.
1. When covered by other seven footers Dirk uses his superior foot speed and pump fake ability to impose his will on these slower defenders. However, as Golden State is proving, when covered by smaller, more athletic defenders, his speed is negated and he lacks the ability and/or willpower to punish them in the post. An MVP should inflict his will upon any/all defenders a la a Kobe Bryant, Lebron James, or Steve Nash.
2. Calling out your teammates publicly in the press and declaring a series over if your team fails to win a game in which you would not technically be eliminated is a big no-no. An MVP leads by example and takes the blame for his teams' shortcomings.
3. He is Baron Davis's bitch. All kidding aside, have you watched this series? If you had not watched a regular season game all year, who would you think the MVP is?
4. The Mavericks 67 regular season wins albeit impressive, were won without ONE significant injury all year to any of their core players. Couple this with the fact that the Mavericks just seemed to play harder than their competition on many nights (they seem to lack that extra gear for the playoffs), and that Phoenix and San Antonio had 61 and 58 wins respectively with significant injury issues-the larger number of wins is quite deceiving.
5. The guy has openly admitted to getting nervous shooting last second free throws and reciting David Hasslehoff lyrics in his head to calm his nerves. Seriously, do you think MJ was humming Wham's "Wake me up before you go go" when he drained that shot on Bryon Russell to beat the Jazz?
(note to editor: if the Mavericks recover from their current 1-3 hole and advance to the next round, please delete this entire column and revoke my blogging privileges).

While back in Vancouver a couple months ago , I spent an entire day digging through my parent's ancient photo albums from long before I was born.

Hey Chris,
Love the photos from the "ancient photo album"
MA dozen Windsor area daycare parents delivered a giant "budget cookie" to Ontario MPP Dwight Duncan's office today asking the Finance Minister to "chew this over" before finalizing a budget they fear may contain up to $63.5 million in cuts. The cookie was decorated with what the parents say are "all the numbers the Minister needs" including how many centres will close and how many spaces will be lost if proposed cuts are in Ontario's 2010 spring budget.
At stake, these parents say, is $63.5 million for 7600 subsidies that help families access affordable child care in Ontario.
The pizza sized cookie delivered today to Duncan's Windsor constituency office was decorated in coloured icing that read: "budget cookie" all around the edge. The centre of the cookie, also decorated with icing, read "7600 spaces" and "300 centres" indicating how many child spaces will be lost and how many centres are expected to close if Duncan allows the $63.5 million in cuts to find their way into his Thursday budget.
"This is about ensuring spaces for children," said one of the parents, Shannon Porcellini, "and it's about parents who rely on subsidies to work and retrain and child care centres that need funding to remain viable."
Porcellini also cited research by economist Robert Fairholm predicting 3,480 jobs could be lost by parents who can't go to work because of a loss of daycare spaces if the cuts proceed and a further 3,030 in job losses in the child care sector.
The loss of subsidies comes at the same time as 4 and 5 year olds are being transferred from community based child care into the school system under the province's early learning plan this coming September. The removal of over 35% of the children they care for will cause centres to close across the province. The government's own analysis estimates that in this year alone 48% of child care centres will be affected.
For background information about child care in Ontario please seeTHE money being used to renovate the John Wood Mansion and the History Museum will be funding well-spent.
Preserving our past is important not only for the present, but also the future. History is what connects generations.
The Historical Society of Quincy and Adams County is in the midst of a project that will see $31,000 of repairs to the mansion at 12th and State, plus the History Museum at Fourth and Maine. Funding for the various projects has been made possible through the Historical Society of Quincy and Adams County's annual membership drive and a grant from Quincy Preserves.
The John Wood Mansion is a fascinating expression of our ties to the past. Named after the man who in 1825 bought all of the land from what is now Front Street east to 24th Street, and from Maine on the north to Harrison on the south, from the U.S. government, Wood oversaw construction of the mansion beginning in 1835, when Quincy's population was about 700.
Wood, who in his life served as both mayor of Quincy and governor of Illinois, hired John Cleveland, a native of Sandy Bay, Mass., to oversee construction of the mansion and its Greek Revival -- or "white plantation" -- style. The structure was completed in 1837 and was one of the first of its kind to be built in the Midwest.
In recent years, time has taken a toll on the mansion.
"It has gotten to be in terrible shape," said Chuck Radel, a member of the HSQAC Board.
Most of the funds raised will be spent on capital improvements to the mansion, including the replacement of such items as rotted floorboards, railings and balusters on the wrap-around porch along the mansion's north, west and south sides. Additional renovation includes painting, plus repair work on shutters, storm doors and storm windows.
Another portion of the renovation involves scraping, power-washing and painting the white picket fence that lines the perimeter of the mansion's property.
Additional work being done on the grounds concerns maintenance improvements to the heating, ventilation and air conditioning units in the mansion and in the Lincoln Gallery inside the site's visitor center.
The list of needs for the mansion is extensive, but important.
"I think it's probably a crown jewel of Quincy and something that the entire community can be proud of," Radel said.
Radel refers to the renovation as a "period-appropriate restoration," which is important because it will continue to allow us to visit our past in the future.Its art, 3:00-5:00pm, at Clayton Fitness.

Grover retires, Franklin named Dean, Trifilo moves to Director
December 17, 2014
PLAINVIEW – Effective in March, 2015, Wayland Baptist University will see faculty and staff transitions involving the School of Math and Sciences as well as the virtual campus that oversees Wayland’s online programs.
Dr. Herbert Grover will retire as Dean of the School of Math and Sciences at the end of the spring semester. Dr. Scott Franklin will move into the Dean’s position and Dr. Trish Trifilo will fill the Director of the Virtual Campus position vacated by Dr. Franklin.
A biology professor, Dr. Grover came to Wayland in 2008 and was named Dean of the School in 2009. Under his leadership the School has flourished. Grover has played a key role in developing the curriculum for majors in environmental science and environmental studies. He has also placed in emphasis on creation care, and raised awareness of the importance of caring for God’s world through conservation efforts throughout the Wayland system.
“Dr. Grover has certainly taken what was already an outstanding academic school and made it even stronger during his term a school dean,” said WBU Executive Vice President and Provost Dr. Bobby Hall. “He has grown the distinctiveness of the academic program with emphases on quality, undergraduate research, and field experience.”
Students in the math and science departments have benefitted through increased efforts in undergraduate research, as well as field research opportunities. The biology and geology departments regularly take study trips, providing more practical, hands-on educational experiences, and all fields of specialization conduct student research projects and present their findings at national conventions.
Grover earned his bachelor’s degree at Rider University in 1974 and a master’s from Rutgers in 1977. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of New Mexico in 1982 and came to Wayland after serving as Professor of Biology at Hardin-Simmons University since 1995. He has also served in various teaching and research capacities at the University of New Mexico.
Grover said the decision to step down as dean is the result of many factors, including the need to move the School into a more technologically driven environment, something he admitted may not be his strength. He also wants to spend more of his time with his personal academic pursuits.
“I look at the things that need to be done and how they need to be done to move the school to the next level and I see there are better people to accomplish that than me,” he said. “And I want to invest more of my energy in environmental science areas that interest me.”
Grover said he hesitates to say he is “retiring” as he hopes this is just another chapter in his academic life.
“Wayland has been the best place I have ever worked in my life,” he said. “I could not have asked for a better place to complete the classroom portion of my career. I will continue to be active and write and create things and teach online, but the mountains are calling and my grandkids are calling.”
With Grover’s departure, Dr. Franklin will move into the position of Dean of the School of Math and Sciences. Franklin, a 1998 graduate of Wayland, earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from Texas Tech University in 2005. He has taught mathematics at Wayland since 2000, and served as Associate Dean under Grover. In 2011, Franklin was named Director of the Virtual Campus.
“I look forward to continuing the high standards and quality leadership set forth by Dr. Grover,” Franklin said. “Our emphasis in the school has always been on engaging and close interaction between our faculty and our students, and we also closely integrate our faith in the classroom.”
As Franklin moves back to the science building, he will leave the virtual campus in capable hands. Dr. Trifilo has been with the VC full time since 2012, serving as the Distance Learning Specialist. Trifilo holds a doctorate in education from Capella University and a master’s degree in science from St. Louis University. She earned her bachelor’s degree at the University of Iowa. Trifilo came to Wayland after working as the director of online learning at Hardin-Simmons University.
Dr. Hall said the transitions to new positions should be seamless with no real disruption in services to students.
“Wayland is indeed fortunate to have the strength, quality and depth among its employees to make these transitions possible,” hall said. “Just as Dr. Grover brought unique strengths to his potion as dean, both Dr. Franklin and Dr. Trifilo are very well prepared to step into leadership rolls.”Sinhala Rap Songs

No matter your stance on gambling, casinos do bring money to the community.
The Black Hawk County Gaming Commission gets a percentage of the profits from the Isle of Capri in Waterloo, and officials say their funds would drop if Cedar Crossing is built. That money is used to improve the community.
"Downtown redevelopment projects with Main Street or something up at [the University of Northern Iowa,] like the scoreboard, those would be very hard to do," said Tim Hurley, with the BHCGA.
Grants include $150,000 to the Waterloo fire department, $60,000 to the Grout Museum, $20,000 to the Arboretum, and $500,000 for the new scoreboard at the UNI Dome.
Still, it's a tough decision.
"We look at other things like the impact on the community, the jobs created, those kinds of things," said Jeff Lamberti, Iowa Racing and Gaming Commissioner. "What new revenue we might generate, and quite frankly there is no magic number set in code or anything like that."
On the other hand, the mayor of Cedar Rapids says the new casino will bring more gaming revenue to the state, but opponents say it'll take a piece of an already limited pie.
A site visit for the proposed casino is coming up in a few weeks, and the final decision will be made a few weeks afterThis Chinese New Year, Xpax is giving away an auspicious red BlackBerry Torch 9800 smartphone EVERYDAY from 20 Jan 2011 to 18 Feb 2011.

On the Christmas morning after his transformation, Ebenezer Scrooge found new delight in life. As Dickens reports in the final stave of A Christmas Carol, !”
For decades, Scrooge had missed the wonders and joys of life. But, with his heart renewed, he could perceive and enjoy the wonders of Christmas morning: ringing bells, crisp air, bright sunlight. For Ebenezer Scrooge, all of this was glorious, glorious!
Scripture often speaks of glory in reference to God. In the sixth chapter of Isaiah, for example, the prophet sees a vision of the enthroned Lord, surrounded by angels who proclaim, “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory” (6:3). God’s glory is not simply in heaven, far away from the brokenness and suffering of this world. Rather, God’s glory fills the earth, however incompletely in this time of history.
The glory of God is, in part, something added to this world, something that radiates from God like light from the sun. Yet, God has also embedded his glory in this world, in the wonders of creation, even in the uniqueness of human life. Most of all, God has revealed his glory in this world by coming as the Word Incarnate, about whom the Gospel of John exults, “[A]nd we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father’s only son, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14).
In the seasons of Advent and Christmas, and, indeed, in all seasons of the year, we can keep Christmas well by delighting in the glory around us. Like Scrooge, we can bask in the joys of the senses, the sublime beauties of this world that reflect the glory of the Creator. Yet, we recognize that earthly glory serves as a pointer to the all — glorious God. Moreover, because of Christmas, because the Word became flesh, we are able to see God’s glory—not just in the reflections of creation, but most of all in the person of Jesus Christ, who radiates the glory of the triune God. As we experience Christ, we are moved to exclaim, “Oh glorious! Glorious!”
QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER:
When you hear the word “glorious,” what comes to mind? When have you experienced glory?
If God’s glory is revealed to us most of all in Jesus Christ, the Word of God Incarnate, what does this show us about God’s glory?
How does the glory of this world help you to delight in the glory of God?
PRAYER:
Gracious God,.
In this season of the year, we are particularly aware of how you revealed your glory in Jesus Christ, the Word Incarnate, in whom we see your glory. In Christ we recognize that your glory is found not only in the majestic but also in the manger. As we reflect upon the birth of Christ in this season, may we revel in your glory. And may our experience of your glory enrich every part of life, every day of the year. Amen.The.
But is this form of retrenchment restricted to isolated cases in the IT industry? Most definitely not. It takes various forms in times of a downturn and things have not changed since the last such upheaval in 2001. Most affected are freshers and junior employees who have no knowledge of the laws or common business practices. Currently, confirmed appointment letters for campus hires are not being honored or simply delayed on various pretexts, with the objective of tiring out the young students yearning to start their careers post a degree program often funded by loans . Anectodal evidence suggests that leading IT companies, backed by marquee promoters amongst others, are employing such tactics. A large captive French-United States multinational corporation is said to have employed worse practices, where young employees working on projects or training were summarily escorted to taxis after being asked to resign across the table.
In this day and age of open information and transparency, such practices pose a serious threat to a company's credibility where it matters most. Ad hoc hiring, highly skewed planning, and an irrational optimism about the future have led to this situation. Mission, vision and culture statements ring quite hollow during adversity and HR managers, who are expected to uphold these values, prefer toeing the management line instead of holding up the mirror to them.
Such anectodal evidence can easily be translated into statistical evidence if the Department of Labor so desires, or students get together on social media or approach the Courts/Labor Commissioner in their respective states.
What is the legal framework on all of this in India? That, unfortunately, is unclear and has been so over the years. IT workers are given fancy designations which keep them out of the definition of “workmen” under the archaic Industrial Disputes Act which governs such situations. It is well understood that this is not the appropriate Act for governing the HR issues of the IT industry, but different governments over the last 20 years have shied away from a enacting the appropriate legislative framework. The IT industry has, since the 1990s, got friendly treatment from governments on three key issues:
(i) A favorable tax regime even when it was large enough not to need incentives.
(ii) Getting massive tracts of land at concessional rates, and then building horizontally despite vertical structures being the norm for much more efficient use of the land.
(iii) Allowing the industry to function without an appropriate legislative framework for HR issues in what is predominantly a people led industry.
It is not my intent to argue for permanent employment but, it is my case that prevention of practices, such as the ones mentioned earlier to merely reduce the costs of separation - especially when it involves young students and junior professionals - is now a necessity. Sensitivity, compensation, and funding for reskilling executives would go a long way in demonstrating some compassion, and a fraction of the huge pile of cash that the IT companies have garnered could be used for such purposes. Keep in mind that India has no social security net like in the West. Many families depend on the progeny that's the first generation to be employed in the new economy. Promoters and managements, who have amassed a fair amount of wealth, can well afford to show magnanimity, if not act out of ethical considerations, and make this process more humane. Similar instances of layoffs in the U.S. would have invited class action suits for wrongful termination and it is the same companies which would have paid millions of dollars to settle out of court. India does not have such provisions of collective action but courts are now selectively more open to hearing such cases.
The other aspect is India's highly flawed educational system which churns out engineers with scant focus on curriculum for emerging technologies to align with industry demand. This requires companies to train their intake. This is done based purely on the basis of skill gaps existing in that particular company at a specific point in time. Freshers are thus thrust into areas purely by chance and not necessarily into technologies which will remain relevant in the mid-term. Based on project needs, many fall for the lure of going abroad even for routine jobs and neglect the fact that continuous reskilling is a must in this industry. This leads to a sense of entitlement when the going is good and exposes deficiencies during downturns. Young professionals must not lose sight of continuously learning emerging technologies to stay relevant.
Many do not know that Kanwal Rekhi, the legendary venture capitalist, and entrepreneur, was fired thrice in his career in the U.S. It was then that he decided that he will never work for anyone ever again. The U.S. has the ecosystem to promote such an endeavor. In India, this ecosystem is still in its nascent stages and operates on a very small scale. For IT engineers, this is the mindset which will help them overcome odds in their journey.
While this transition happens over the next generation, IT industry doyens and the government should look to holistically address the problem of layoffs, which are likely to only increase over the next few years. Taking short cuts and promoting dubious practices will ultimately come to bite the very hand which has led us to prosperity these last thirty years.

Hello, one and all! I know that we will see some of you at Christmas but for those of you not in Utah, have such a Merry Christmas! I know that our week leading up to Christmas is filled with parties and such, but it will be fun. For those curious about the pictures, yes the tradition of the vacuum tree still lives on and Peter loves wearing his cowboy hat so I had to get a picture of him in front of the tree.
Tonight we watched the short nativity movie done by the church and it is so nice to talk to Caleb and Peter about the birth of Jesus and see their excitement. And Peter is so cute as he says, "Geesus." Kids are so cool! We hope you have a wonderful, peaceful Christmas and that you can feel the spirit as you remember Jesus' love. We will talk to you all after the first of the year. We are going to California with Ed and Carole for a week so that will hopefully be relaxing and fun. Enjoy life and the holiday spirit. We love you all!

Sounds like a blast! Have fun with the warm weather!

This book is a couple of years old and set in a different state, but it reminds me SO MUCH of my kids' high school right now. I gave some thought to reading it to them to see what they thought of it, but also to give them some insight to being on the other end of some of the craziness of school.
Posted by: CR Fan | 28 June 2017 at 08:41 AM
I will admit that I cannot be at all objective about Mr. Keizer's books, since I was fortunate enough to be one of his students some 35 years ago. But his first book, NO PLACE BUT HERE, makes an interesting companion to GETTING SCHOOLED; it's a similar memoir of teaching, set at the same high school, but written at the beginning of his career. (And as for PRIVACY? You're in for a treat; it's a delightful and thoughtful little jewel.)
Posted by: Keith | 28 June 2017 at 02:23 PM
CR Fan,
Sigh. Trying to give insight, as well as the insight is written, to high schoolers might be a tough slog.
And yes, that attitude probably proves why it's a good thing I never became a teacher.
Keith,
Hey, how cool is that (that you were a student of Keizer's)? Thanks for commenting. And thanks for the heads up on his earlier book. I want to read his whole catalog, just have to find the time and requisite attention.
I'm totally sold on "Privacy"; I did get most of it read and know it's something special. But I do want to re-read it more closely.
Posted by: Citizen Reader | 28 June 2017 at 04:46 PM
One of my favorite lines in the book is when someone looks into a classroom and asks about the goings-on and a student says something to the effect that it's ok..."we have Mr. Keizer with us." That said, I preferred PRIVACY. The Enigma of Anger is somewhere between the two books, in terms of essays and personal memoir.
I am interested, Keith, in how you felt things had changed or stayed the same between the two books on education...
Posted by: CR Fan | 29 June 2017 at 08:05 AM
I think the biggest changes are in technology. In the early 80s, computers were unheard of; now, every kid is expected to have one, and all of the homework is spelled out on a class web page (where the parents can see it, too), and is probably even turned in via computer.
On the downside, I think there's been a change in parental involvement. When I was in high school, my teachers could assume that if there were serious problems in the classroom -- behavioral or academic -- that a call to the parents would help to resolve matters because, in all but a handful of cases, the parents would crack down on their end.
I am no expert in the field, but the sense I get from GETTING SCHOOLED is that these days, that assumption is less safe; it's probably still true in most cases, but the exceptions are no longer as rare as they were. And I think that the assumption that parents care, and are willing or able to help, has always been truer in small, rural high schools like mine than it has in larger, urban high schools. If he's struggling with parental involvement in rural Vermont, I can't imagine what that struggle must be like in the poorest and roughest neighborhoods of Los Angeles (where I live now) or other large cities.
What's stayed the same is something that Mr. Keizer (after all these years, it still feels wrong to just say "Keizer" without the courtest title) doesn't address directly, but that he is certainly an example of: The quality of education you get is largely a matter of luck. Is your school any good? Do your teachers know what they're doing? Do they have the resources they need, and if they don't, do they have the creativity to make classes interesting and informative without them? Do they CARE about the results they get? Mr. Keizer was, and I assume he still is, a superb teacher, and those of us who spent time in his classes were extremely fortunate. He and his colleagues when I was a student (and the new book suggests this is still true) worked very hard without a lot of money to spend on the sort of extras and frills that kids in wealthier schools might have access to.
Posted by: Keith | 29 June 2017 at 12:42 PM
Thank you, Keith. I would guess you are right. I will have to read the earlier book when I get a chance. I'm glad you experienced Mr. Keizer as a good teacher. I have learned from him as an excellent writer. Lucky us!
Posted by: CR Fan | 29 June 2017 at 01:43 PM
Having been a "Contributing Editor" myself, I can explain that you get that job title when you, as a freelance writer, have established a close enough relationship with the real Editor of the magazine to be given a freer reign on the kinds of stories you want to bring to the magazine. That's all. There is no power attached to it, except that the Editorial staff knows your name and won't make you wait six months to get paid for a feature.
Social revolution will do nothing to make poor parents talk, or read, to their kids more. The inequity of parental quality (did I say that right?) will never be eradicated. Like Keith said, all of life is a matter of luck, and that's something that you can't legislate away. It doesn't take a village: it only takes two people willing to do the work, and there are too many people out there not willing to do the work.
That image of the two-pointed pencil on the cover of Mr. Keizer's book . . . is it a pushmi - pullyu kind message, right? Going nowhere?
Posted by: Vivian Swift | 30 June 2017 at 09:34 AM
Keith, CR Fan,
thank you for having your discussion here. So many interesting things to think about. I find it so interesting that once a teacher known as MR. Keizer, always a teacher known as Mr. Keizer. He himself talks about that sort of thing in the book when he admits he can't call the principal anything other than Mr. Messier. I am not big on the prefixes myself (if you call me Mrs. Cords I simply won't realize you're talking to me) but to hear them used with such respect is refreshing, I must admit.
Posted by: Citizen Reader | 30 June 2017 at 10:39 AM
Vivian,
Oh, sadly, I know exactly how being a contributing editor does not lead to fabulous prizes or great wealth. My point is that it SHOULD. If tons of people out there are making a lot of money running cell phone stores, and they are, well, dammit, writing a good sentence should also be worthy of some remuneration. I'm a little bitter about the whole writing thing since I read that Canada actually has a lot more freelance writers and entrepreneurs because they're not all AFRAID TO DEATH ALL THE TIME that they won't have health insurance. This country is cruel.
I don't know what the answer is, but this idea that we can bring all kids up to the same level through education is a dangerous idea. Dangerous like "pull yourself up by your own bootstraps."
You know, I never gave much thought to that pencil image. Thank you for drawing it to my attention--you can see I'm not much of a pictures gal. I'm going to have to think about that now too.
Posted by: Citizen Reader | 30 June 2017 at 10:44 AM
I think the image is also the teaching equivalent of "burning the candle at both ends;" the stress of the job is a theme of the newer book.

Posted on January 8, 2018 by Marian Salzman
Originally published on HuffPost.
Anybody who has been in the trends business as long as I have (nearly three decades) has mixed feelings about Nostradamus.
There’s respect for the fact that a French seer born in the boonies in 1503 is still creating buzz five centuries on. There’s envy over his unearthly medieval toolkit, which included not just an actual crystal ball but also necromancy, astrology and a smattering of other Dumbledorean techniques. And there’s a touch of annoyance that people confuse the prophesying he did with what we do, which is trendspotting—an art and science centered on cultural scans and requiring copious legwork (both virtual and real).
Nostradamus is on my mind because his name has become a kind of shorthand for the imminent threat of bad stuff happening. For me, hearing his name more than once in a week is a reminder to check the Doomsday Clock—which, as it turns out, now stands at two and a half minutes to midnight, 30 seconds closer than last year. So, what’s new to worry about this year?
The specter of nuclear war is back as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump trash talk each other and flash their nuclear muscles. The U.S. president’s tweet-warnings about having a “bigger & more powerful” nuclear button than Jong-un and about putting into motion “fire and the fury like the world has never seen” has prompted high-level concerns on both sides of the aisle about fidgety fingers near America’s nuclear launch codes.
Then there’s all that extreme weather, which some attribute to climate change and others to divine punishment. Either way, the ride is getting wild. Speaking of bombs, a “bomb cyclone” is all set to drop on the Northeast, leaving it in white-out conditions and with potential power failures. Meanwhile, cities along the Gulf Coast still struggle to recover from the massive rain dump of Hurricane Harvey in September—the third “500-year flood” in three years. The situation in Puerto Rico is even direr in the wake of Hurricane Maria. Wildfires—which in October raged through Northern California, causing an estimated $3 billion of damage—returned with a fury in the southern part of the state, driven by powerful Santa Ana winds.
Crime is a perennial worry for Americans, but it’s not the mass shootings and other acts of violence that concern us most. Gallup reports that this year again, Americans’ crime worries are topped not by terrorism (30 percent) but by cybercrime—whether it’s having sensitive information stolen (67 percent) or being the victim of identity theft (66 percent). These have been leading concerns since 2009, but cyber-insecurity has been ramped up over the past 18 months by reports of Russian hacking of the 2016 election. If the U.S. electoral system isn’t safe, what hope have we for our retirement funds?
And speaking of finance … Ten years since the first rumblings of the subprime crisis, money is an enduring worry for many Americans. And now experts are issuing warnings that the sequel to the global financial crisis is here. If (when?) the markets for collateralized loan obligations do collapse, as they did in the 2008 financial crisis, today’s ultra-high-frequency electronic trading systems make it likely to happen in milliseconds. That’s scary enough in itself without factoring in the possibility that it could be triggered by hostile individuals or states deliberately hacking into the system as an act of cyberwarfare.
Even if the financial system manages to hold firm, there’s the widely covered prospect of artificial intelligence taking over life as we know it—a prospect that Elon Musk famously sees as a bigger risk than North Korea. In his latest bestseller, Homo Deus, influential author Yuval Noah Harari envisions a future dominated by machines. Since “99 percent of human qualities and abilities are simply redundant for the performance of most modern jobs,” Harari sees computer algorithms outperforming humans across a whole range of work. One consequence could be what Harari calls a “useless class” of people who will be not only unemployed but unemployable.
Even this brief scan of the status quo in early 2018 shows there’s more than enough to get anxious fingers reaching for the panic button. But are things riskier now than in Nostradamus’s time, when life was fraught with plagues, famine and war? Or riskier than a century ago, when a simple cut could lead to a deadly infection and average life expectancy in the U.S. was just 48.4 years for men and 54.0 for women? Our take is that the everyday life of the average American scores pretty low on the old-style threat-o-meter, but instant communication, combined with a fevered 24/7 news cycle, makes for a pretty constant feed of anxiety-inducing information that is addictive and great for ratings. The trend is clear: steadily growing anxiety with occasional spikes of full-on panic.

Synopsis
Where Does Fruit Come From? by Linda StanifordThis fascinating book looks at how fruit is produced, taking the oranges we eat as an example. It shows us how oranges are planted, grown then harvested, and how they are shipped to supermarkets or stores to land on our tables. It highlights that not all food is local, often coming from very far afield.

think about whether or not whoever submitted the clip

In the nation's first such ruling, a federal judge on Wednesday said copyright owners must consider "fair use" of their works before sending takedown notices to online video-sharing sites.."
This is an important ruling, because copyright holders have increasingly been using abusing the DMCA's takedown provisisions, like Universal did in the case this ruling stems from -- a mother who posted a clip of her dancing kid, which included a few seconds of a Prince song playing in the background. "Psychic" Uri Geller did the same thing to someone who posted a documentary about him on the site. And overeager "Boostbusters" have been taking down clips that the copyright owners actually wanted up -- like footage of a Led Zeppelin concert last year.
This doesn't actually mean that the mom in the Prince/UMG case will win her case, though -- she's asking for damages, and the ruling simply says the case can proceed.

She sparkles with vitality and good humour, and apart from being a talented professional golfer, she is a mean guitarist and singer who even penned her own Olympic song a few months ago.
Lovelady is one of two Brazilian women golfers who will tee up at Reserva de Marependi Golf Course on August 17 (the other in Miriam Nagl), and she admits that excitement over Rio2016 is now reaching fever pitch in the city where she grew up.
And she is certain that the Brazilian culture will win over the hundreds of thousands of visitors to Rio and the billions glued to their television sets. It’s in the DNA of the Cariocas.
“Yes, definitely,” she asserts. “If we Brazilians know anything, it is how to host sports events and to party. It’s in our blood. People coming to Brazil discover there is a always a little surprise factor. I tell everyone that Brazilians know how to have a good time. In a crisis, we like to have a party!”
Lovelady just squeezed into the Olympic field, after missing out on automatic qualification. However, when some National Olympic Committees opted not to put forward their golfers to attend the Olympic Games, her name was restored to the top 60.
Although now resident in Sao Paulo, her family has enjoyed close connections with Rio. She said: “My great grandfather was one of the founding members of Itanhanga Golf Club and my dad got me started in golf when I was 12. I always followed him in trying sports, so I said I wanted to try golf, too.
“Golf has brought a lot into my life. In the beginning I was able to win events locally and I loved the competition. I went to the United States to play high school golf and told my parents I wanted to stay there. I was living with my godmother in California when I earned a scholarship to play for University of Southern California (USC) and we won the national championships when I studied there. Once I saw the possibilities in golf in the U.S. I knew that is what I wanted to do.”
Lovelady believes Rio is ready for its grand opening, despite some obstacles along the way. She added: “I was back in Rio almost a month ago and there is a sense of excitement. I have seen the contructions finish and the media is giving the Games more attention, people are getting excited and talking about getting their tickets. The city is going to be ready.”
She certainly believes the golf course is ready to host a remarkable party of its own, irrespective of the happenings on Copacabana, Ipanema and the Maracana. Lovelady took part in the official Test Event alongside eight other Brazilian male and female golfers in March, and revelled in the experience.
“The course really surprised me. I was very impressed” she insists. “I knew we had problems in the beginning with the legislation so I didn’t know what to expect. However I did know that the course was in good hands with Gil Hanse, who is such a great designer. It was an amzing experience to play it.
“I actually walked the course last November when it was inaugurated by the City with the Mayor. I think it’s very challenging – the angles of the greens, the tee shots and especially the landing areas because there is no rough, just former waste land which is now an environmentally protected area.”
She added: “The greens are small and undulating and I knew it was going to be so tough. I think the quality of grass they used is perfect. The way the ball responded on the greens and fairways, the grass just tees up the ball and it’s a great feeling to hit off that surface. I was excited over every shot I hit.
“With the greens and the angles, the course is really fair and rewards your good shots. I thought, with the course being new, I wouldn’t have that type of response but it was great. It was harmonious, it was challenging. You had to think of landing areas and there are holes that encourage you to attack.”
Lovelady pinpointed two holes in particular which caught her eye, the par four 13th and 16th. She continued: “The 13th is a dog-leg right where you can cut through the trees on the right but not too much. I did that and lost my ball. I was two under at that stage in the Test Event. The other is 16th, a short par four and the long hitters can go for the green but the chip afterwards can be challenging. It was awesome. I really enjoyed it.
“I would say No.13 is probably the signature hole because the green is really challenging. It’s not an easy approach and the green is so undulating. I also liked the par three fourth. It’s a cool hole.”
Lovelady is praying that as many people as possible come to watch the Olympic golf competitions in person, as well as follow the action on TV. And in the future, she fervently hopes that Rio de Janeiro will have a public golf course to attract a new generation of golfer.
She said: “One of the great things is that someone who is curious to grab a club and a golf ball is going to have access to this. It is a huge first step. The surrounding areas of the course is residential, with high rise buildings. I feel if I was a kid living in one of those buildings and I looked down from on high and saw a golf course that I could go and have access to, I would be really excited. I would be saying; hey mom, hey dad, I want to try that.
“In Brazil we are really good in sport. I often see first swings from beginners that are pretty impressive. I really hope they do golf programmes with local high schools to bring the kids into the game for the first time. Now you can rent clubs and I believe it will be a big boost for the sport in our country.”
Despite her local connections, Lovelady won’t be staying privately with family or friends. She insisted: “I am staying in the Village. I want the full experience. How cool is that? To be with the athletes is so much fun. The girls have been asking me about the course and I tell them it’s so much fun to play and very exciting, but that Rio the city will be, too.”

The spot market opened at 6.9006 per US dollar and was changing hands at 6.9012 at midday, 13 pips stronger than the previous late session close but 0.09 per cent weaker than the midpoint.
For the week, the yuan is on course to finish flat on the US unit.
There was some corporate dollar demand on Friday, traders said, but they noted that the thirst for the greenback was eclipsed by the higher mid-point.
"The yuan was still trading range-bound," said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai.
Some institutions took advantage of tiny price swings to make intraday trades for quick profits, which pushed up daily trading volume to US$14.45 billion as of midday.
Beijing is scheduled to hold the Belt and Road Forum on May 14-15, and traders expect the foreign exchange market to remain stable in coming days as authorities usually try to avoid any volatility ahead of and during major political and economic events.
The Chinese yuan faced some downward pressure earlier in the week when the yuan midpoint was fixed at its lowest for several weeks amid a broadly stronger US dollar.
The yuan's downside was contained on those days as major state-owned banks sold US dollars in the onshore market, though none of that activity was evident on Friday. Traders said the dollar sales were done to meet corporate demand.
The Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNH index, which tracks the offshore yuan against a basket of currencies on a daily basis, stood at 94.16, firmer than the previous day's 94.11.
The global US dollar index fell to 99.579 from the previous close of 99.623.

Fixtures for the season are however being finalised for the league that has been projected to run until the end of November.
PSL chief executive officer Kenny Ndebele said they are currently engaging their sponsors and various stakeholders before coming up with a substantive 2015 itinerary.
“Provisionally we have set 7 March as the date to commence this year’s league campaign. We are still consulting our stakeholders so that we come up with exact dates of events this year,” Ndebele said.
“I am sure in the next two weeks we would be having a clear picture about the season’s calendar. For now, it is also still early to tell when exactly we will release our fixtures.
“Cup competitions will be confirmed in due course. We intend to finish the league late November but if we have more tournaments and other events it gets longer.”
There is also still darkness over the Mbada Diamonds Cup that had been scheduled for late last year but was cancelled by the sponsors at the last minute.

NEW YORK —.
Right-hander Vic Black is being recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas to fill Valverde's spot.
The Mets bullpen wasted a fine start by Jacob deGrom.
The 25-year-old deGrom pitched 6 2-3 scoreless innings in his third career start, allowing five hits. He labored early but settled in to throw 122 pitches.
With the help of an umpire's review, New York took the lead in the fifth inning.
The Mets two-out rally was started by — who else? — deGrom. He lined a single to left field for his second hit of the day — the college shortstop is now 4 for 5 as a big league hitter — and advanced when Juan Lagares walked.
Murphy lined a single to right field and deGrom scored easily. Josh Harrison's throw to third skipped past third baseman Pedro Alvarez and Lagares scampered home. The ball took a good bounce back to Alvarez off the protective fence in front of the Pirates dugout and he made a quick throw home.

An economic study commissioned by Salmon Beyond Borders concludes that transboundary watersheds facing potential adverse impact from British Columbia mines are valued at just under $1 million, when considering a 30-year horizon. The study by the McDowell Group, a Juneau research and consulting firm, measures the economic impact of the Taku, Stikine and Unuk river watersheds on the Southeast Alaska economy. The study found that, combined, these watersheds account for $48 million in direct spending, 400 jobs for the Southeast region and nearly $20 million in labor income. The study, released in late November, also estimated the exvessel value and first wholesale value of Mass and Skeena River sockeye salmon caught commercially as $620,000 and over $1.3 million respectively.

Last revised 23 Feb 2002
©2002 C. GagnonFour years ago, traded life policy (TLP) funds were labelled as potential replacements for with-profit funds. Three years ago, certain fund providers were pushing for their own IMA sector.
Last week these same fund providers stated that TLP funds were never intended for the retail fund-buying community after the FSA labelled them “high risk, toxic products that are generally unsuitable for the majority of UK investors”.
When a fund makes its return by estimating the date of someone’s death, marketing is always going to be tricky. This task was made no easier when, in August 2006, the American viatical marketmaker Mutual Benefits Corporation (MBC) was prosecuted for fraud. It was found guilty of understating the life expectations of policyholders, which therefore increased the value of their policies.
Despite this, in the years afterwards several funds have been launched to British investors, with the promise of returns uncorrelated to those of equities or bonds. Indeed, back in 2007 a report issued by Professor Merlin Stone of the Bristol Business School, said TLPs might be the best alternative to with-profit funds. For this to happen however, the report said more needed to be done to raise the profile of TLP funds among IFAs. (Comment continues below)
A year later, some TLP product providers said they wanted to lobby the IMA to create a new sector to help promote the asset class. This never happened, given their offshore domiciles and lack of Ucits III status, but the thinking was that a peer group would help promote the asset class, with retail investors in mind.
Odd, then, that these same providers are now at pains to point out that the funds were only ever aimed at “sophisticated investors” (see news analysis, page 12).
Owing to liquidity constraints, TLP funds have never been able to be packaged as Ucits III funds, and last week’s FSA statement will likely be the death knell to any groups looking to change this.
The key problem has always been what happens if a fund runs out of cash and cannot continue paying the life assurance premiums. If this happens, the policies effectively become worthless.
Most of the groups, to give them their due, have always stated that an education drive has been needed to increase demand, but is this drive alone enough to transform so-called retail investors into sophisticated investors?
Just last month, Managing Partners told Fund Strategy it deals with retail investors as long as they are sufficiently sophisticated. However, it added that it is down to the IFA to categorise who is sophisticated and who is not.
SL Investment Management, which has long maintained TLP funds are not suitable for retail investors, puts IFAs in the same category because they rely on the people selling the product for information.
There are far more problems with this investment than understated life expectancy and companies running out of funds to pay premiums. In the US there are hundreds of lawsuits filed to void policies issued to seniors who fraudulently acquired insurance. In some cases courts allowed insurers to cancel the policies and keep the premiums.
Some of these fraud cases insured a retired bus driver for millions; people living in low cost housing whose income is limited to government benefits; a man who filed for bankruptcy two years earlier with a net worth of minus.
So-called sophisticated investors are not as sophisticated as they would like to think of themselves. They do not know half of what they need to know.
Would you invest with a principal whose previous company, doing the same exact thing, went belly-up and was cited in court for selling fraudulent policies to investors. Too many of these con artists recycle themselves, new company name, new state, new investors, new funds, same-old fraud.
Ms Wolk’s comments are quite pertinent in understanding some of the problems with running a TLP fund. There is too much unknown.
In theory the process should be relatively straightforward in that the statistics are reasonably well founded, so the capital and cash flow requirements are quantifiable, allowing sufficient prudent margin for changes in life expectancy. Whilst this may not make for a mainstream investment, it should not require a “sophisticated” investment label.
What is making these funds so high risk is incompetent management and a heavy level of fraud. Since we have been aware of these two elements for quite some time now (the Shepherds Fund collapsed in 2005) it is amazing that the FSA have been so slow to raise questions. Competent management and fraud should be a high priority on their regulatory agenda. It is clear from other scandals that they do not have the tools or the understanding to do such a job.
Rebranding these policies as “Sophisticated” is real head in the sand stuff. Whilst wealthy people may be able to withstand such scandals better than the less wealthy it is no more palatable. And when the losses are predominantly based on fraud and incompetence, and not market conditions, then there is no justification for exposing the wealthy to such risk.
Until this basis of this market it cleaned up it should be banned. It is totally impractical to assume that advisers can do the background work to ensure that funds are being properly run; there has to be a certain level of trust for the market to run at a reasonable cost level.
If the FSA are out of their depth then that I would strongly recommend that advisers stop using these funds until either the providers can demonstrate explicitly a satisfactory level of prudent management, or, as a group, provide a copper bottomed level of guarantee on future behaviour and returns. This may be hard on the reputable providers, but the never ending loses have been a darn sight harder on the purses of honest investors.Installing exhibition prints of Larson/Shindelman's ACP Public Art project today at Big House Gallery. Excerpt from a Q&A on ArtsATL.com with Larson/Shindelman about Geolocation: Atlanta, their twitter-based public art / billboard installation project for ACP 2012.
ArtsATL: Where are the billboards located? Shindelman: All up and down I-75, I-85 and I-20. The photos and tweets all happened within a mile of the billboards. ArtsATL: How did you obtain the tweets? Shindelman: It’s all in the public timeline of Twitter. These are people using GPS; their phones tag their exact locations. Larson: Everything is located using a cell phone these days. The idea of place is deeply embedded in the culture of cell phones. ArtsATL: What do you do when you arrive at the sites? Shindelman: We look at it like an editorial project. Our parameters are to make a photo that somehow interacts with the text. We might photograph where the person is tweeting from or what they might’ve been looking at. Larson: We start making decisions about how to make it an interesting picture. We could have the best tweet in the world, but if we can’t make a good picture then it usually gets edited out.We'd love to see the first photos of their work on the digital billboards! If you see one, tweet us @acptweets or use hashtag #acp2012 on instagram!The real currency in SEO is the number of links that you have to your site. It determines your rank in the search engine result page (SERP) and hence the incoming traffic. It’s a very simple equation, but not an easy one to solve. Hence, link building is an important aspect of SEO. So, how do you do it? Link building campaigns are the answers. However, organizing the campaign properly can be really tough, especially because of the low success rate that comes out of it. So, how do you maximize the link building campaigns?
One size DOESN’T fit all
If you have tried writing a generic email and forwarding it to as many link partners as possible, then you couldn’t have done a worse campaign. There are so many problems with this approach that it might take one email just to explain them! Every link partner is different and hence the email requests which you send for backlinks should not sound too generic.
Send acquaintances
It’s not like ‘Hey, I just met you, this is crazy, here’s my website, link me maybe’. The link partner should at least know you at some level. It is likely that being webmaster you might have met numerous other webmasters at different conferences and seminars. Your success rate will increase if you send acquaintances rather than total strangers.
Use templates with caution
You might have sent many link requests in the past, and would already have your favorite template. However, you should not let this fact be obvious from the email that you send. Every request should have a sense of personalization. A way to do this is to circulate the email among your colleagues and get information on whether it appears personalized or not. To keep things fresh, you should write new template for each type of group. While making the templates, keep enough room for personalization. Just before sending it, spend a few minutes making the email as specific as possible.
Have something meaningful to give
Your link partner would be persuaded only when you have something valuable to offer too. You can’t of course provide a backlink to the link partner because it would have a negative impact on the SERP rankings. The help can be in terms of arranging for links for the partner from different sources, or maybe even connect at a personal level, maybe give an ego boost in some way.
Link building is pretty much like building a relationship with humans. There is always the factor of sincere investment of time and an honest effort in ensuring mutual satisfaction. Your outreach program should highlight these things to your link partner. Do these well, and your success rate in link building campaign would have a very positive impact.
LogicSpeak:
Backlinks play a very important role in today’s date; they are one of the strongest pillars in raising your site on top in search engines. Hence it is very much necessary to acquire backlinks from relevant and authority sites in order to achieve a good link profile. In short, the mantra to be kept in mind while acquiring backlinks is ‘Be a real person and connect with real people to earn links’

RACIAL VIOLENCE IN THE MIDST OF A SHRINKING WORLD
By Mike Lovely 17 Jan 2015
A main topic of discussion and concern for All Peoples United Church Of Christ, (APUCC), has been the increase in police/racial violence. The “straw that broke the camel’s back” was the Michael Brown incident in Ferguson, Missouri. APUCC began a discussion on how to bring more public attention to this situation and try to cool public tension on this unfortunate. Several slogans were discussed and we decided on one for a “button campaign”. “ALL LIVES MATTER” was the winner. This project is a passion of Gloria Olson and she went to Via Delia in Bend and personally paid for a bundle/variety of “ALL LIVES MATTER.” Thank you Gloria!! We passed around the buttons and took some to hand out.
As I was reading The Bend Bulletin on Sunday, December 28, 2014, the political cartoon caught my eye. It centered on ALL LIVES MATTER!! I contacted Jack Ohrman, the cartoonist who works for the Sacramento Bee, a northern California newspaper. I told him of our button project and I would like to use his cartoon on our church website as part of our button campaign, because of the phrase, subject matter, and timing of the public violence situation. He said yes and thanks for asking. He also asked me to send him a button. The button is in the mail…. An ironic side point, Jack worked for The Oregonian, for twenty eight years. And of course we had a short “Oregon” discussion.
Below left is the political cartoon Mike saw and the buttons Gloria designed on the right.

Good mood for you and look foward to talk with you!MoDOT telling motorists to avoid travel this weekend
This is the direct warning drivers throughout the region are seeing on their way home Thursday night.
The Missouri Department of Transportation is using tough language in its warnings - phrases like "use extreme caution".
"It isn't usual to have this much ice," said Lynelle Luther - MoDot's top maintenance engineer.
MoDot says 400 workers manning 200 trucks are ready - but they're asking for the public's help telling motorists to stay off the road.
"When it happens, we need time, we need room to actually work," said said Marcus Slaughter with KC Scout. "We can't be effective if the roads are cluttered with cars."
When the ice storm hits, KC Scout camera operators will be watching well-known trouble spots like that hill on I-35 northbound leading into downtown Kansas City by Bartle Hall.
"On icy events, if you get some semis that start spinning their wheels, you can actually lock up northbound I-35," said Marc Sommerhauser.
That's why they're being blunt. Don't go out unless you must - and if you're out - go slow.Parents of children with VTech tablets have been told information about their little ones - and possibly their photos - have been stolen by a hacker.
The Hong Kong-based company has admitted that 10 million accounts have been affected by the cyber attack - 6.3 million belonging to children.
VTech is known for making tablets and other electrical toys for kids, many of which include cameras and apps.
In a statement the company said: "We can confirm that on November 14 HKT an unauthorized party accessed VTech customer data on our Learning Lodge app store customer database and Kid Connect servers.
"Upon discovering the breach, we immediately conducted a comprehensive check of the affected site and have taken thorough actions against future attacks."
VTech confirmed that children's profiles - including names, gender and birthdates - are among the information stolen.
Adult accounts including names, mailing address, email address, password retrieval questions, IP address and passwords have also been compromised.
According the company, no credit card information has been stolen.
Mum Lisa, from Wilmslow, has a six-year-old son who uses the VTech Innotab.
She said: "It is a bit worrying how someone could possibly have pictures of my son.
"VTech should make it child friendly and I shouldn't have to worry about if my son uses the camera because it's such a great thing for him to play with."
Customers affected by the attack have been contacted by email.
There is currently no information on who may have committed the cyber crimes or what their motive may be.
VTech added: "Our investigation to date suggests the breach is on the server, not on the device itself. There is no evidence to suggest the toys are not safe at this time.
"We will continue to investigate and share more information as it becomes available."Davenport imaging, and registering for elective seminars and lectures.

OneNeuroprotection is an area of research in multiple sclerosis.
The permanent symptoms of MS develop when nerve cells are destroyed. This is thought to occur when nerve fibres are exposed to chemicals produced by the inflammation of tissue that MS causes. The theory of neuroprotection is that, if the nerve cells can be protected from these chemicals, destruction of nerve cells - and thus further permanent problems - can be lessened or prevented.
Neuroprotective drugs will not be able to reverse progression or restore lost function. However, if suitable drugs can be developed, it is hoped that this will mean that the progression of multiple sclerosis can be significantly slowed down - something that is not possible with existing medication.
Research
Different aspects of neuroprotection are being examined, concentrating of different elements that lead to loss of nerve cells.
Glutamate receptor blockers are aimed at controlling one of the chemicals involved in transmitting messages from nerve cell to nerve cell. Excessive glutamate can lead to the loss of nerve fibres and early research is looking at the effects of trying to control this.
- Riluzole is a glutamate inhibitor that is used in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neurone disease. A small study involving 16 people with primary progressive multiple sclerosis did not show any definite effect. There was a trend for a reduction in MRI changes but not in clinical measures of disability.
Inflammation leads to the increase in levels of nitric oxide and sodium, both of which can damage nerve cells. Research is underway to examine the effect of blocking these chemicals.
- Lamotrigine is a sodium channel blocker sometimes used to treat pain in MS that has been studied as a potential neuroprotective drug, though the results did not differ from placebo.
- Phenytoin is a sodium channel blocker used to treat epilepsy. A study in people with optic neuritis found that people who had been treated with phenytoin showed less damage to nerve cells in the retina than people taking a placebo.
Other drugs that have been used in other conditions have being investigated for their neuroprotective effect in MS:
- Amiloride has shown signs of limiting damage to nerves in a small study of people with primary progressive MS though more research is needed.
- Ibudilast has been studied in people with relapsing remitting MS to see if the drug would have a neuroprotective effect.
- Eliprodil has been investigated as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. There have been very early laboratory trials in MS.
- Cannabis was studied in a trail called CUPID that showed it was no better at reducing progression than placebo.
Amiloride, ibudilast and riluzole are being studied by the the MS-SMART trial for a neuroprotective effect in people with secondary progressive MS.
Research in this area is at a relatively early stage and these studies are exploring the potential of neuroprotection as a strategy rather than the possibility of making particular drug available to people with MS in the short-term. That said, if this work does lead to drugs that can slow down the progression of multiple sclerosis, this will be a major step forward in an aspect of MS for which there are currently no treatments.

Biography:.Review by Christos T. PanagopoulosSlovenia - Italy 84-77Slovenia opened the Second Stage of the home EuroBasket with victory. The hosts prevailed against Italy to jump at 2-1 record in Group F. Italy suffered the first defeat at the tournament to slip at 2-1.Goran Dragic (190-PG-86) stepped up with 22 points and 6 assists to lead Slovenia. Cusin and Aradori gave the visitors an early advantage. Italy maintained the lead throughout the opening quarter.Alessandro Gentile (198-G/F-92) and Belinelli made it 21:18 for the Azzurri at the first break. But Slovenia opened the second frame with 7 straight points to pull ahead. Alessandro Gentile returned the lead to Italy but not for long. Begic sparked a 6:2 run from the hosts as they accumulated a 40:34 advantage. Slovenia arrived at halftime up by 6 points 45:39. Aradori and Luigi Datome erased the deficit early in the third term. But Slovenia reacted with a 10:0 run to clear off. They ensured a 60:54 lead at the final break. Alessandro Gentile and Belinelli tried to keep the Azzurri in the game throughout the fourth frame. Luigi Datome and Aradori trimmed the deficit to just three points 72:75 with just over two minutes remaining.

Confirming David Nugent's arrival - pending a successful medical today - Harry Redknapp has said to sky sports news that his signing 'shows how far we've come'.
As well as saying 'I'm delighted to have him. He works hard and that's something Portsmouth fans like.
'We have brought some real good players in and I think with a couple of strikers, people like Nugent coming in, it will be a good season for us.
'To get him in that will be great, but I'm still looking for another one and then we will have a decent squad'.
It has been a long drawn out saga, but one that will - baring any unforeseen problems with a medical, which should not happen - be concluded today with a happy ending. And will see Pompey sign an exciting young prospect - and better still an English prospect.
Seeing his solo effort on sky sports news on Tuesday, where he waltzed through a defence from the halfway line before scoring, reminded me what a great young talent we are picking up, if I needed reminding.
I look forward to seeing this other too - whoever he might be.

Let Gwen Stefani show you the stylish way to do so. The 43-year-old porcelain pop star has been protecting her skin with a parasol when she's out and about in sunny LA. Chic, huh?
What's not so chic, however, is this other way to do it. At a beach resort on China's east coast, holidaymakers have been showcasing new facial protection in the form of robber-lookalike masks. While we don't want to judge and do applaud their anti-ageing commitment, face-kinis aren't a trend we'll be trying, thankyouverymuch.
We say adopt the umbrella approach and arm your skin with decent sun protection. In this weather make sure you're not relying on the SPF in your makeup alone, you'd need to be applying a lot more than you actually do to stay safe and there's need to pile on the slap in summer.
Use a high factor face cream, such as the Clinique SPF40 or SPF30 Face Cream which is suitable for sensitive skin but has high level protection against both UVA and UVB rays.
Another product we're loving is the Goldfaden MD Sun Visor, an SPF30 sunscreen spray that you can apply before or after makeup. The oil-free ultra fine mist is handy way to top your protection and refresh your makeup throughout the day. Handbag hero.
If you don't feel confident pulling off Gwen-like 'pale and interesting' get in the bronzing business but don't bake, fake.

I wanted something with room in the back so I can move things at will, but still went easy on gas and was maneuverable. So far I really like this car.
I also turned 29 earlier this month. Tina gave me a really nice 22″ widescreen monitor. It’s surprising how much that changes everything. (Coming from my old 19″ crt.)
Anyway, I need to go get stridera.com back up…. been putting it off for too long and I need it to host the website we’re building for my final project for school.
LaterSpring 2011 - Parasitic Disease Forecast
Nematodirosis in lambs:
Nematodirosis is a severe disease of 6-12 week old lambs, which become infected through ingesting large numbers of infected larvae present on contaminated pasture. The life cycle of the Nematodirus battus worm is unusual in that there is a mass hatching of larvae in spring when the soil temperature increases after a period of cold weather. year's lambs off pasture that was grazed by lambs last year.
December was one of the coldest months on record and these cold and dry conditions continued in January. Milder, wet weather dominated in February, while a predominance of high-pressure systems in March brought dry and settled conditions. Soil temperatures during March indicate that peak hatching of Nematodirus larvae would occur in most areas of the country during the period 9th to 21st of April. However, in Atlantic coastal areas hatching may have occurred earlier i.e. week of 2nd to 8th April, and lambs may show clinical signs of infection two to three weeks from these dates.
Lambs should be dosed with a suitable anthelmintic in early to mid-May to decrease the likelihood of clinical problems later and also to lower pasture contamination for the next year. It is especially important, that farmers, with large sheep enterprises and where "safe" pasture is not available i.e. this season's lambs are now grazing pasture where lambs grazed last spring, treat their sheep with an appropriate (narrow spectrum) anthelmintic at this time. When dosing for nematodirosis, farmers should be cognisant of the principals of sustainable control of intestinal parasites and should only use anthelmintics effective against adult worms.
Coccidiosis in lambs:
It is also important that farmers are aware that other parasites this parasite. Raising feeding troughs will also help reduce the contamination of feed with faeces.
It is advisable to consult a private veterinary practitioner for an accurate diagnosis and advice on appropriate medication if lambs with severe diarrhoea and straining are observed. Faecal samples can be submitted to the Central and Regional Veterinary Laboratories for testing. This service is available through private veterinary practitioners and can be used to assess the level of parasite infection on farms and also to assist in the development of parasite control programmes.

Another important thing that is definitely taught in Pandora's Container, is you need to know which kind of girl she is. While in the program, there are 6 different categories. You want to find out this, because not all girls is also the same. Just like not everyone is the same and just as not all people including the same things and want identical things, girls are not any different either. If you know what category the girlfriend is, it will be much easier to attract the young lady. One way to find out any type of the girl is to ask her the "3 hidden knowledge questions. " Once you understand the answers and whenever you identify her personality sort, you will then need to implement one of the strategies in the Vin Dicarlo Can of worms guide.

The beads disney pandora charms are expensive
A little bit of handy information when acquiring one of these
pandora disney uk
bracelets is that your Troll beads cannot visit onto the Pandora bracelet even so the Pandora beads can line onto the Troll bracelet helping you to mix and match a tad bit more and make your bracelet much more customisable. This is worth doing - as I do believe the silver charms in the Pandora range are much better than in the Troll with regard to better moulding and the silver finish will be a lot cleaner rather than oxidised Troll selection. The advantage also is always that Troll do a greater group coloured glass beads. Whether you purchase a new Troll bracelet or Pandora bracelet - They're such a fantastic notion for presents- even christenings - The thought is to get your beloved started on their own bracelet you'll be able to add to them at special occasions not anymore having a difficulty in deciding things know about get them for Holiday! It works out definitely well for both celebrations!
If you are for instance me, you are continually searching the Internet for

music. The latest band that your friends recommended, a song you heard on the radio driving to job, the perfect melody and keep you working hard while working out, a rhythm you can certainly tap your foot that will, an old song that reminds you of a person or an enjoyable experience in your life. Exceptional songs, live songs, acoustic songs. Melancholy songs, upbeat music. I could go on forever. And it is obvious to see why. Music defines you; it is a constant within our lives, an ever expanding definition of who we have been. As we grow, so do the size and style of our libraries in addition to our tastes and consequently, so does our desire for food for discovering more genres, more artists, more songs to fit our moods, our training sessions, our lifestyles and some of our personalities. So, no wonder it drives us crazy if we can't find the song that gets stuck in the head or the name of the opening act at a show that him and i saw and fell in love with.
I've been recently there, believe me. In the past, this impasse dragged
disney pandora bracelets
me into its black hole often times. Many of you get solutions to that short lived song-stuck-in-head or can't-remember-the-artist- title insanity. iTunes, Amazon, imeem and also Last. fm all work as anecdotes. If you will be like me, you are probably sick and tired of the radio. It never plays anything you want to hear. Them plays three songs and then cuts to commercials. When it does play music, it would not mention what the musician and performer or song titles will be, leaving you in the dark while you find something you just like. The radio is a strong excruciatingly painful experience today. Granted, there is a lot music out there. It really is hard to get each artist on the air flow, but they could at least act like they worry about getting the word available about good music that's not in the mainstream. And so we become fed way up. We go home as well as we delve into what we should have previously found. We may occasionally produce the foray into selecting new stuff to tune in to and talk about amongst ourselves but should you have read any of the previous articles, I like to pay attention to things that make what exactly I love, simple.
I like to generate things easier for us all and in doing and so, I try
pandora christmas charms
to get the word available about gadgets and gear that accomplish that objective. Pandora is one of those tools. You may have heard about it already because experts agree it is out since the season 2000. Nevertheless, I believe there being people out there who may not use it enough, use strictly iTunes or maybe Amazon or other websites and you will find likely others who have never heard of it at all. For almost everyone, I want to get upon myself to get you to consider Pandora. It might change how you listen to music, it wonderfully might change your lifetime. Pandora is everything you need in a radio station. That's because it's ones radio station. I were using it off and on frequent and every time I do it, I not only hear music i love but I am qualified to find music that was troublesome finding elsewhere. Without having fail.

RSSIt’s no surprise that a product coming out of Rockstar Games’ development studio would receive a wide range of excitement, hype, high expectations and applause; it’s also no surprise that Rockstar never fails to deliver on all aspects. Sure, there are some methodologies implemented in say, Grand Theft Auto IV or Red Dead Redemption that some gamers weren’t a fan of. Some said Liberty City was too bleak and colourless. Some weren’t interested in an old western cowboy theme. These seemingly petty, albeit completely valid opinions might seem nonsensical to some – considering that Rockstar’s games have never received anything lower than an averaged 9 out of 10* – however, Rockstar always seems to take every opinion at face value and incorporate the feedback from the fans into future projects. That, my friends, is one of many signs of a quality company.
When Rockstar Games officially announced that Grand Theft Auto V was in development, there might as well have been a riot in the streets of every major city; the reception of the announcement was wholly positive and anticipant, and gamers started circling dates in red on their calendar to take a week off from work, call in sick at school, or what have you. Understandably, with the small percentage of gamers that were disappointed with Grand Theft Auto IV – not as a whole, but with most aspects of it – there was a twinge of scepticism and concern, but it seems that the development and marketing crews at the company simply reclined in their chairs with their feet crossed on their desks and said, “Just wait.”
Grand Theft Auto V takes a huge leap forward from its predecessor and almost continues into the next-generation of gaming and returns with some features and material that we gamers would not expect from the current generation, due to perhaps lack of effort or innovation or perhaps the fear of trying something new. Rockstar Games threw caution to the wind here and took what they’ve learnt over the course of several years and incorporated their notes alongside what was and was not successful this generation, fan opinions and concerns and produced a truly magnificent masterpiece.
For the first time in Grand Theft Auto history (and perhaps even the history of gaming itself) you are put into the shoes of three, vastly different protagonists whose individual lives and stories come together to create an interwoven narrative that reminds me of something Tarantino would take inspiration from. These protagonists are able to be controlled at virtually any given point in the game and when the other two are not being directly controlled by the player, live their own personal lives and engage in their own activities thanks to an advanced AI component implemented in the game. When dropping in and out of the three characters, what they’ll be up to varies nearly every time based on the time of day and previous activities participated in. There is virtually never a time where the player will jump into one of the character’s lives and see them doing the same thing.
Grand Theft Auto V reintroduces San Andreas as gamers had asked, prayed and crossed fingers for since we entered the seventh console generation. It’s an expansive, beautiful and colourful world that is larger in scope than Liberty City multiplied by five. We’re introduced to the three protagonists, Michael, Franklin and Trevor; three men with their own different personalities, behaviours, vices, set of friends and preferred leisure.
Michael, a retired, former bank robber, is in his early forties living with his dysfunctional family living off of the proceeds of his former life in the upper class Rockford [Beverly] Hills. His wife, Amanda, a suburban mistress of extravagance, spends more time out and about, spending all of Michael’s money, than at home and is most likely having an affair with her yoga instructor. Michael’s daughter, Tracey, is the rebellious, Kelly Osbourne meets Britney Spears wild child, who claims her parents are ruining her life by merely existing and is seemingly the type to run off with a member of a motorcycle gang. Lastly, is Michael’s son, Jimmy, the stereotypical Hollywood rich kid – think Justin Bieber, but more rotund – who spends his time smoking weed, playing video games and pretending to be of African American descent, a drug dealer, a ‘gangsta’…or any combination of the above. “Let’s bounce, homie.” Michael retired from his life of crime after making a deal with the FIB and after realising he’s running out of money quickly and is tired of being bored and miserable, decides to return to the criminal path.
Franklin, speculated to be in his mid-twenties, never really had a family, money or an education to rely on. During his adolescent years, he became a gangbanger and dope dealer, but was arrested shortly afterwards. Following his release from prison, he started working for Simeon Yetarian, an Armenian, luxury car salesman whose dealership is a front for extortion and vehicle repossession. Franklin soon meets Michael and they perform a job together; after Michael notices potential in Franklin, he calls him the “son he’d always wanted,” and introduces him to his best friend, Trevor Phillips.
Trevor, a sociopathic maniac, entered the military as a pilot sometime in his earlier life. Not too long after his retirement, he meets Michael and the two go on a series of heists together, but suffer a falling out and consequently, a rift in their friendship is formed. Years later, with Trevor now in his forties, has run out of his robbery-earned finances and reconnects with Michael, who introduces him to Franklin, and the trio go on a series of Reservoir Dogs styled heists, thus forming the main story of Grand Theft Auto V.
In the event that you haven’t put two and two together yet, Grand Theft Auto V’s story revolves mainly around pulling off increasingly audacious heists, from knocking off jewellery stores to ambushing armoured vans, to high-stakes bank robberies. However, these heists are far and few between. There are only a small handful of them and they all serve as plot devices to keep the story going, some more than others. You won't find yourself earning serious money (ergo, anything more than a few hundred thousand dollars) until the final heist. These acts of Hollywood-style felonies are provided to the player in different methodologies of execution. You’re able to execute what I like to refer to as the methods that James Bond himself would raise a martini to, or the methods that Rambo would shoot an RPG into the air in celebration for.
Your choices affect the subsequent consequences, including the time you have to collect the stash, how much you’re able to escape with, and how easy it’ll be to evade the constabulary. Before performing the heist, you’ll be able to choose your methodology and following that, select from a list of qualified participants to assist you. Your options range from safe crackers, to muscle that provide assault support, to a getaway driver. Each selection comes with multiple applicants with varied skill; the higher skilled assistants will get their job done faster and more efficiently, but also desire a larger cut of the proceeds. On the other hand, you have the less skilled criminals who take longer to open a safe, but don’t demand a larger percentage. You’re also tasked with finding an exemplary spot to ditch the getaway vehicle and transition into something less conspicuous; in other words, park your second getaway vehicle down an alley before the heist, head on over after the heist and ditch the vehicle the police are looking for.
One of the more tantalising features that Rockstar improved on is the wanted system. The police, when either protagonist has a wanted level, will search for you based on description, and if in a vehicle, based on vehicle description. Police vehicles each have their own search zone on the radar and no longer miraculously know exactly where you are. You can drive around as normally, as long as you stay out of their field of vision. You can also avoid them by turning down the next street, hiding in an alleyway or parking lot or away from main roads. However, the higher the wanted level, the more in-depth the police searches become. They'll search the parking lots and the alleyways, so evading them proves a bit more difficult. Depending on the severity of your wanted level, if you're able to evade the radars, you may switch vehicles which will often throw the police off your scent, allowing you to casually drive past the alerted cars. Once you've escaped, go reward yourself with some new clothes or a haircut or maybe some tattoos.
You heard me correctly; character customisation has returned…but not as prominently as in San Andreas in 2004. Eating too much won’t make you fat and exercising won’t build visual muscle. However, you’re able to purchase clothes for your character – shirts, pants, shoes and glasses, and mix and match between outfits – as well as change hairstyles or facial hair and get tattoos. It’s not a wildly vast customisation scheme like in Saints Row or even The Sims, but it’s prominent, aesthetically pleasing and not overwhelming whatsoever.
What might prove to be overwhelming is the fact that while you’re allowed to customise your character, you’re also allowed to customise your weapons. Gone are the days of a tactically inferior arsenal! You’re more than welcome to mosey on down to the local Ammunation store and select from a nice inventory of pistols, submachine guns, rifles, what have you, and customise to your heart’s content. Throw on a suppressor, your choice of reflex, red dot or magnifying sights, an extended magazine, laser sight, underbarrel attachment, etcetera. You’re able to make your weapons your weapons, and they aren’t simply aesthetic customisations, but functional ones. Twisting on a suppressor to your favourite handgun will lessen the sounds of your shots which allow for silent kills without alerting nearby enemies. Civilians still somehow hear the suppressed shots and flee the scene and the police are still alerted. Your rail-mounted sight will allow for greater range and accuracy and the mounted fore-grip will allow for greater accuracy, stabilisation and control. It’s just what a professional criminal needs! Your customised weapons remain in your inventory even after running out of ammunition, dying or being arrested. You’ll never have to worry about losing the money you’d spent customising it.
Lastly on the heart-attack freightliner is the ability to customise your vehicles. Yes, as featured in San Andreas in 2004, but vastly improved and varied. Customisation includes aesthetics like rims, spoilers, body kits and interiors, and performance upgrades like engine tuning, brakes, steering and nitrous. It is also possible to over-tune your vehicle. Your customised vehicles are saved and you’re able to keep your favourites in your personal garage, and any vehicle of yours that is lost or totalled can be recovered from an impound lot for a price. In addition, should you be driving a convertible vehicle, you can retract and deploy the soft/hard top at will. There are no longer ‘variations’ of convertible vehicles with the top up or down. It’s now entirely in your control. Just don’t put the top up or down while the vehicle is in high speed. Not that you could, sadly, but we wouldn’t want a car careening off the road and squishing flat any pedestrians. Actually, yes…yes, we would.
Continuing onward, yes, you are able to purchase property in Grand Theft Auto V, but it is not as Rockstar Games led us to believe. Remember in the official gameplay trailer where it demonstrated being able to locate property for sale on the Dynasty 8 real estate page? Well, that was a fabrication. The only property you're allowed to purchase are businesses that generate a rather disappointing weekly revenue. So if you're expecting to blow your hard-earned money on mansions with ten-car garages, you're going to be terribly disappointed. The only garage you may use to store vehicles is the one garage that your character is given, which can fit two vehicles and a motorcycle. Unless you'd picked up the collector's edition of the game which gives players an 'extra' garage which can store five vehicles.
Owning businesses in Grand Theft Auto V isn't a matter of just owning a building like in San Andreas. Purchasing a business actually has its perks; owning the taxi company means you won't have to pay for cab fare. Owning a helipad or hangar means you have a place to store helicopters or aeroplanes. Owning a dock on the marina means you have a place to store watercrafts.
You may also purchase stocks from BAWSAQ including Ammunation (AMU), Bittersweet (BTR), Burger Shot (BSHT), Fruit Computers (FRUC), Sprunk (SPUK) and Whiz Wireless (WHIZ) to name a few. Owning stocks in companies is another way of earning (or losing money) if you’re willing to put your understanding of the stock market to the test…and of course, take a gamble. Reading up on the companies, listening or watching news reports will give you an idea of how the company is doing with its finances and whether or not purchasing a stock is a good idea. Grand Theft Auto V is centred on earning money and earning it fast; playing the stock market is one of the few legitimate methods of obtaining exorbitant amounts of currency...if the feature actually worked.
The stock market in Grand Theft Auto V is virtually frozen. It doesn't work. You're able to purchase stocks, yes, but you'll never see an increase or decrease in the company's value. It's almost just there to take up space, unless the feature will be reworked to arrive hand-in-hand with Grand Theft Auto Online. Either way, it's an incomplete feature in the game and that is not acceptable.
If there’s one thing Rockstar Games is known for, it’s their humble outlook on learning from past mistakes and taking into account what worked, what didn’t and actually making the effort to revitalise what needs to have the volume turned up. Gameplay in Grand Theft Auto V is a significantly large improvement to that of Grand Theft Auto IV and it seems that Rockstar did not let anything get in the way of producing the features exactly as they wanted them to be, as we gamers wanted them to be and how they should be. General mechanics such as character movements have been noticeably improved; each character has their own signature walk – although nothing as badass as Timothy Olyphant’s signature walk – and it seems fitting to their personality. Michael walks with a firm, yet I’m-bored-with-life demeanour. Franklin has a determined, focused, yet relaxed swagger about him. Trevor…well, needless to say, he walks aggressively and looks determined to sodomise the next person he sees with his foot.
Combat has taken a huge turnaround and Rockstar definitely turned the volume up for Grand Theft Auto V. You’ll find the combat to be an interesting and functional hybrid of Grand Theft Auto IV and Max Payne 3, and the two mechanics come together instrumentally in a myriad of utter brilliance. While using firearms, or simply having one equipped, the aiming reticle is similar to that of Max Payne 3, allowing the player to free aim while moving and essentially “run and gun” unrestrictedly, unlike Grand Theft Auto IV. You’re also given options in the settings menu that carried over from Max Payne 3 that allow complete free aim, soft lock or hard lock auto-assists; when pulling the left trigger to aim your weapon, hard lock will lock on them completely while soft lock will lock on and then allow you to move the reticle to different parts of their body or away from them completely. With free aim, it’s up to you to manually move the reticle to your target. Targets react to gunshots properly and each weapon has its own understandable level of power, which of course is upgradeable.
For the first time in Grand Theft Auto history, a weapon wheel is implemented and it seems to be a hybrid of that from Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption. Players are able to keep multiple weapons of different types in their inventory; the top wedge for pistols, top-right diagonal for submachine guns, the right wedge for assault rifles, the bottom-right wedge for sniper rifles, the bottom wedge for melee or to holster a firearm, the bottom-left wedge for shotguns, the left wedge for special weapons (grenade launcher, RPG, etc.) and the top-left wedge for explosives like grenades, C4 or dynamite. Toward the bottom right of the weapon wheel, it’ll also indicate with an appropriate icon whether or not you have a parachute in your inventory. With this new system implemented into Grand Theft Auto V, you can now simply hover over the pistol wedge and press the left or right buttons to cycle through the handguns in your inventory and choose the one you’d like, whether it be a Desert Eagle, a Taurus PT92 or a fully automatic pistol.
Vehicle handling has greatly improved since Grand Theft Auto IV and despite original speculation based on leaked footage, it is not arcade-like whatsoever. Every car handles differently and they all have the appropriate feeling of mass based on the type of vehicle it is. Motorcycles also feel heavier and more responsive and it’s just as fun weaving in and out of traffic on two wheels as it is on four. The new handling serves itself well, as it’s easier to manoeuvre about and pull off some pretty amazing moves; drifting, J-turns, 360’s, and last-minute executions are completely responsive, easy and fun to pull off. Vehicle handling also depends on the character's skills; for example, Franklin has a pre-determined professional skill in driving, so cars and motorcycles are more responsive to his touch. With Michael, however, who needs to develop his driving skill, driving is heavier and more clunky since he isn't as skilled as Franklin. It's an understandable and brilliant counterpart to the game's mechanics and it works beautifully.
In the end, Grand Theft Auto V did not deliver on all of the aspects that Rockstar Games had promised - or at least nudged toward - in terms of purchasing property, having different and varied ways of obtaining money earlier in the game and the emphasis on robberies. Your work in pulling off the main heists in the game often feel as if it were for nothing; Trevor still lives in a ratty, run-down trailer. Franklin gets himself a nice Vinewood home. Michael remains where he lives. At the end of the day, the only thing you have to spend your money on is clothes and vehicles. There's no casinos to gamble in, the stock market feature is non-functional and the overall experience feels empty afterwards.
However, looking at the game for what is actually is, overall, Grand Theft Auto V has proven itself to be a masterpiece of this generation. With 69 story missions that are replayable at any given moment (except whilst progressing through another mission), the story is vast and in-depth but not long enough that one would grow bored. The narrative progresses at a desirable pace and even after completing the main game, there is an overwhelming handful of other things to do on the side. Grand Theft Auto V introduces San Andreas as we’ve never seen it before, and Rockstar Games has essentially taken everything that we loved about Grand Theft Auto, everything we wanted, and everything it should have and mixed it into one big concoction of sheer brilliance.
Grand Theft Auto Online is a whole different story. It's a great concept...but its execution is horrendous. Rockstar Games postponed the launch of Grand Theft Auto Online to two weeks following the release of Grand Theft Auto V and quite frankly, the delay was not long enough.
From the start, players experienced numerous issues connecting to the servers; it seems Rockstar Games foolishly failed to anticipate the vast number of gamers who would attempt to go online the moment the feature launched and did not prepare properly; they lacked the necessary numbers and reliability of servers to accommodate players. We're assured they're working around the clock to fix the reported issues; some people are playing without an issue while others are experience game-breaking problems.
Grand Theft Auto Online puts players in the shoes of their own, customisable character within the Grand Theft Auto V world; the setting takes place shortly before the events of the main game. Players are able to create their character's face based on heritage: what their grandparents looked like, how their parents looked and which parents' genes they incorporate most. Players who'd picked up the collector's edition of the game are able to choose special characters from previous games to use as their parents: Niko Bellic from GTA IV, Misty and Claude from GTA III and if you'd connected to the Social Club, you'll also be able to choose John Marston from Red Dead Redemption. You may select a gender here as well. Following the heritage generator, you then assign hours to your character's activities, including legal and illegal work, partying, sleeping, spending time with family, sports and exercise and sitting on the couch. It affects their skills and their visual appearance. Lastly, you select their hairstyle, colour and give them a name.
The introduction establishes that your character met Lamar Davis through LifeInvader and have been online friends for quite some time. Lamar invited your character to move down to Los Santos with opportunities to make a ton of money and a name for themselves. After giving your character their first gun, you're introduced to Hao who sets you up with a race and then allows you to bring a vehicle of your choice from the streets and fits it with a tracking device and insurance, with the vehicle becoming your personal mode of transportation.
After completing the introduction, the world is yours...metaphorically speaking. You're able to receive jobs from important characters in the game - some of whom you've met through the main story - and earn yourself money, reputation points (which help you level up) and job points. As demonstrated in Grand Theft Auto V, you're able to spend your earnings on clothes, weapons and further customisation: tattoos, vehicles, vehicle modifications, weapon modifications and altering your character's appearance at the barbershop. It should be noted that items in the Grand Theft Auto Online world are significantly more expensive and harder to obtain than in Grand Theft Auto V, as Rockstar seems to be policing the game and disallowing players from obtaining mid-to-high level equipment early on, just because they have the currency to do so.
Grand Theft Auto Online is essentially one, large open world. You can drop in and out of jobs and game modes at your leisure, without having to join or leave sessions, unlike in Grand Theft Auto IV. It's virtually seamless, aside from the loading times due to server connectivity issues. You're able to go anywhere and do almost anything from the start, providing you have the means and the money to do it. Heists are currently unavailable and will not be added until Rockstar fixes the issues currently presented, so the only ways of earning money at this moment is through robbing convenience stores, completing jobs, selling a stolen vehicle every once and awhile (there's a cooldown period) and killing other players in the world who have bounties on their heads.
Money earned can be deposited into your character's bank account, to safeguard your earnings from being stolen by other players upon your death. Which brings me to the biggest annoyance within the game: you have to be on your toes at all times, because with every death whether it be on a job/mission or exploring the world, you lose money. The variation is dependent on how much money you have, whether it be in cash or in your character's bank account; upon death, you lose 5% of the money you currently have. So if you're in a session with a bunch of players that like to run around and kill other players senselessly, it'd be wise to leave unless you're confident in your abilities to survive. Otherwise, you'll be broke before you know it.
Your best bet is to go into a private match with friends and members of your Social Club crew, to avoid losing thousands of dollars in lieu of trigger happy children in public sessions.
Further annoyances aren't that far and few between; driving any other vehicle that isn't your personal vehicle warrants a wanted level by the police, as the vehicle is stolen. Evading the police works temporarily, but if you drive past a law enforcement officer in a vehicle that does not belong to you, the heat is back on. It's no longer a matter of Grand Theft Auto V where once you escape, you're safe until you commit another crime.
It seems that in Grand Theft Auto Online, you're penalised for doing what you're supposed to do. You're penalised for having fun, you're penalised for exploration, you're penalised for dying and you're penalised for pretty much anything that's applauded in the main game.
Until Rockstar Games sorts this utter mess out, I'd pass on this disappointing and annoying online feature.
All of these reviews and gameplay videos are going to make me crazy for this game! Thank you!
Just a question though. Would you call it the best GTA game ever made? Kicking SA and VC from the throne? Just want your opinion about it since GTA SA has always been my favorite GTA game and I hope GTA V would replace it :)
Quite a detailed review, Val.
Seeing as how soon this popped up since GTA V's release date, did you find a store that broke the street date or something?
And I also caught wind of me being so popular that I'm in the game. Go me! :D
Okay, I'm sold. When I have the money, I'm picking this up. So, what say you? Game of the Year contender?
Good review I agree, this game is a masterpiece

Why Winter's the Best Time to Join the Gym
For many people joining the gym symbolises the beginning of the next step of their health and fitness journey. While you can get amazing results by working out from the comfort of your home, a gym membership comes with the advantages of trainers with years of knowledge and expertise, fitness classes, equipment, and machines that are way too pricey and bulky for home use. If you're deliberating over joining the gym, read on for three reasons that might convince you to take the plunge ahead of the New Year.
It Can Be Cheaper
By the time it gets to the end of the year, gym attendance and memberships start to tail off because most people are busy preparing for the festive season. Many gyms offer joining deals that involve some form of incentive to entice new customers, which can sometimes mean you're paying significantly less than you would by joining at any other time.
It's Quieter
January and May-June are generally the busiest months at the gym, the former because many people are getting into the swing of their New Year's health and fitness resolutions and the latter because some people workout in preparation for Summer holidays. The Winter months are a great time to join the gym because the quieter atmosphere allows you to familiarise yourself with all the equipment and try out classes that tend to have mile-long waiting lists at other times of the year.
You Get a Head Start
As the saying goes, it's easier to stay fit than get fit. If you usually quit your fitness goals to take the Winter off, then struggle to get back into it come Spring, getting a gym membership and signing up for a few weekly classes might help you remain consistent throughout Winter. You'll also be able to find your training stride ahead of the January rush and ease yourself into a consistent routine.Dr George Leonard Carey is the 103rd Archbishop of Canterbury, enthroned on 19 April 1991.
He was born on 13 November 1935 in Bow in the East End of London. His father worked as a hospital porter and George was the eldest of five children. After failing his 11-plus he completed his secondary education at Bifrons Secondary Modern School in Barking, leaving school at 15.
He was first employed as an office boy with the London Electricity Board, going on at 18 to do his National Service in the RAF. His religious curiosity had already been kindled by Christian friends who had taken him to the local church. There he was able to explore some of the big questions about God and life which had been on his mind. After his time in the RAF he returned to the Electricity Board, but had already decided to seek ordination. He studied intensely to gain a place at King's College, University of London and the London College of Divinity. He graduated with a degree in divinity (BD) in 1962 - and was ordained deacon in the same year.
Dr Carey spent four years in his first curacy at St Mary's, Islington in North London. He continued to study and was awarded a Master of Theology degree for a thesis on Church, Ministry, Eucharist in the Apostolic Fathers. From Islington he went onto the staff of Oak Hill Theological College as a lecturer in theology in 1966, moving to St John's College, Nottingham in 1970 where he also served as Chaplain. During these years he obtained a doctorate for a thesis on how 2nd century Christians understood the nature of the Church.
From 1975 to 1982, Dr Carey was Vicar of St Nicholas' Church, Durham where he led the church forward in a programme of expansion and renewal. He described this period in his book The Church in the Market Place. In addition to his parochial duties he acted as a prison chaplain to a youth custody prison. He also maintained his links with the RAF, serving as chaplain to the Durham branch of the RAF Association.
In 1982 he was appointed Principal of Trinity College, Bristol and saw the college through a time of change and growth. During his five years in Bristol he served as an elected member of the General Synod and was appointed a member of the Board for Mission and Unity, subsequently serving as Chairman of its Faith and Order Advisory Group. He was also a member of the Council of the Advisory Council for the Church's Ministry (ACCM). In addition he has served as a member of the Theological and Religious Studies Board of the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA).
Dr Carey is author of fourteen books of theological issues including our understanding of Christ, ecumenism, relationships with the Roman Catholic Church and the existence of God. He has also contributed articles and reviews to many journals and periodicals.
Dr Carey became Bishop of Bath and Wells early in 1988. Once in office he introduced and conducted a series of teaching missions, seeking to deepen faith and knowledge in deaneries and parishes. He has continued these in the Canterbury diocese since he became Archbishop in March 1991.
Dr Carey, who played a variety of sport in his younger days remains a keen supporter of Arsenal Football Club and can often be seen at the FA Cup Final. His other interests include reading, walking and listening to music. He is an enthusiastic user of computers and new technology. Despite the vast pressures of his office he is now also working hard to improve his French.
His wife Eileen is the daughter of Scottish parents, Mr & Mrs Douglas Cunningham Hood, who moved to Dagenham shortly before the war. Mrs Carey was born there and was educated at South East County Technical College in Barking, Essex. On leaving school she completed a qualification in Nursery Nursing (NNEB) and a SRN at West London Hospital. Mrs Carey later worked in the Radio Therapy Unit at Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood. Dr and Mrs Carey were married in 1960 and they have four grown up children (two daughters and two sons) and twelve grandchildren (nine grandsons and three granddaughters). In 1998 Mrs Carey, together with her son Andrew, co-authored a book "The Bishop and I", which tells the story of 22 Bishops' spouses from around the Anglican Communion.Senior center opens in Weiner
The Cardinal Center, Weiner's new senior citizen center, opened to a packed house Sunday afternoon.
According to Mary Norris, the idea for the senior center started last July when a group of citizens got together to see what they could do for the community. They formed the Cardinal Community Service Group.
The group came up with several goals they wanted to accomplish for the community and decided to focus on building a senior center first. Thanks a General Improvement Funds grant of $8,000 from Rep. John Hutchison, volunteers got to work turning a building across from Weiner Elementary School into a senior center. Norris said the group was able to get a ten year lease on the building, which formerly housed teacher apartments.
Norris said the volunteers put in over 1,500 hours of work to make the center a reality. "This is Weiner. This is how the community works. It always has, and I hope it always will," Norris said.
In honor of the opening for the new senior center, County Judge Charles Nix declared this week to be Senior Citizen Week for Poinsett County.
Norris added she hopes the Cardinal Center becomes an integral part of the community. "We want it to be used. We want it to be part of the community's lifeblood," she said.HAATI LTD has been working since 12/29/2014.

Norf’k is not a standardized language and there is a great deal of variation. Family differences play an important part and, although the island occupies fewer than 40 square kilometres there are some regional differences between Cascade, Steels Point and Anson Bay varieties.
The principal differences, however, are determined by the proximity of the language to English. Speakers of the older generation (50+) grew up in a stable diglossic situation. For most speakers under 50 the domains and functions of English and Norf’k are no longer clearly separated and traditional Broad Norf’k is increasingly replaced by a more anglicized Norf’k. Many of the youngest generation do not acquire Norf’k at home but through formal teaching at the school or deliberate relearning in later life. Some speakers employ an instant Norf’k by adding a small number of Norf’k words, vowel pronunciations and idiomatic expressions to their English. The examples in the APiCS dataset (default lect) were obtained from conservative older speakers wherever possible.Website Worth and Statistics for Domain: ngn.com

How engaged are visitors to n. ‘Legal.”
Now, does anybody recognize the flaw in this? Aside from the utter illegality of it, and aside from the brazenness, they’re actually out there,
“We gotta insure, we gotta make health care accessible for illegals.”
Shoring up their spines on the contentious issue of health care and immigration?
The flaw in this, why would an illegal buy health insurance when the emergency room’s right there. Why would an illegal do it? There isn’t going to be a private plan to buy into anyway. Why would an illegal risk registering and then pay the fine for not having health insurance, when the emergency room’s right down the street?
So the real ploy here is to use legal immigrants as a wedge to get illegal aliens taxpayer subsidized down the road.
The illegals are going to be covered. That is the objective. Obama says no, but he has to say that. That’s why the number 47 million uninsured miraculously became 30 million.
There’s nothing new here… same old intentions from the same old liberal agenda.

2017 College Quest, LLCBY KEVIN JONES – ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR
There are a select few jobs in the world where you are able to take your children to work every day. Some of these include the occupations of small business owners and family farmers. We have recently learned that Major League Baseball player is not one of these occupations.
The recent decision of White Sox first baseman Adam LaRoche to retire from baseball after a twelve year career including six teams got some attention, especially after people found out what led to his retirement.
LaRoche was pressured to leave the White Sox after the team’s management told LaRoche that he could no longer bring his teenage son, Drake, to the ballpark and the clubhouse every day like he did the year before.
The team’s management would allow Drake to be brought to the clubhouse “every once and a while” but there had to be limitations.
It makes sense that when somebody spends half of the season on the road they would want to spend as much time with their children or significant others as they could when they were home. It is also understandable that baseball front offices would not want children of players in the clubhouse every day in order to prevent players from getting uncomfortable. It is the same argument some front offices use to force players to use headphones if they want to listen to music in the clubhouse.
There are some that feel that a baseball team’s clubhouse is for the private use of the team’s players. Due to this they believe that there may be things going on in a team’s clubhouse that parents might not want even their teenage children to see or hear, such as vulgar language.
Some people argue that preventing player’s children from being on the field or in the clubhouse could lower the number of player’s whose children also have major league careers. They would argue that if teams had these rules there would be not be images like a young Ken Griffey Jr. sitting next his father in the clubhouse. They would also argue that if Bobby Bonds did not have his son Barry involved in his major league career and even go as far as to name the great Willy Mays as Barry’s godfather, Barry may not have gone on to have the career that he did.
One of the more enjoyable aspects of baseball’s Home Run Derby during their All Star Weekend is seeing the players sitting on the field with their children watching the game. It would be a shame if that aspect of the game was lost.
These arguments may have some validity but the thing is that baseball team’s front offices are not trying to completely ban the children of players from the field or the clubhouse. They simply want some limitations on when or how often players can have their children on the field or in the clubhouse.
The fact is that the White Sox management did not force LaRoche to leave, he decided to retire when he was told his son could no longer be on the field and in the clubhouse every day. The team’s management said that it had nothing to do with his son’s behavior, but was about making sure all the players were comfortable in the clubhouse.Details

1. WE have said that the object of regeneration is to bring the life of believers into concord and harmony with the righteousness of God, and so confirm the adoption by which they have been received as sons. But although the law comprehends within it that new life by which the image of God is restored in us, yet, as our sluggishness stands greatly in need both of helps and incentives it will be useful to collect out of Scripture a true account of this reformations lest any who have a heartfelt desire of repentance should in their zeal go astray. Moreover, I am not unaware that, in undertaking to describe the life of the Christian, I am entering on a large and extensive subject, one which, when fully considered in all its parts, is sufficient to fill a large volume. We see the length to which the Fathers in treating of individual virtues extend their exhortations. This they do, not from mere loquaciousness; for whatever be the virtue which you undertake to recommend, your pen is spontaneously led by the copiousness of the matter so to amplify, that you seem not to have discussed it properly if you have not done it at length. My intention, however, in the plan of life which I now propose to give, is not to extend it so far as to treat of each virtue specially, and expatiate in exhortation. This must be sought in the writings of others, and particularly in the Homilies of the Fathers.38[9] For me it will be sufficient to point out the method by which a pious man may be taught how to frame his life aright, and briefly lay down some universal rule by which he may not improperly regulate his conduct. I shall one day possibly find time for more ample discourse, [or leave others to perform an office for which I am not so fit. I have a natural love of brevity, and, perhaps, any attempt of mine at copiousness would not succeed. Even if I could gain the highest applause by being more prolix, I would scarcely be disposed to attempt it],39[0] while the nature of my present work requires me to glance at simple doctrine with as much brevity as possible. As philosophers have certain definitions of rectitude and honesty, from which they derive particular duties and the whole train of virtues; so in this respect Scripture is not without order, but presents a most beautiful arrangement, one too which is every way much more certain than that of philosophers. The only difference is, that they, under the influence of ambition, constantly affect an exquisite perspicuity of arrangement, which may serve to display their genius, whereas the Spirit of God, teaching without affectation, is not so perpetually observant of exact method, and yet by observing it at times sufficiently intimates that it is not to be neglected.[1] Many have been already pointed out in different parts of this work; but we shall here also briefly advert to some of them. With what better foundation can it begin than by reminding us that we must be holy, because "God is holy?" (Lev. 19:1; 1 Pet. 1:16). For when we were scattered abroad like lost sheep, wandering through the labyrinth of this world, he brought us back again to his own fold. When mention is made of our union with God, let us remember that holiness must be the bond; not that by the merit of holiness we come into communion with him (we ought rather first to cleave to him, in order that, pervaded with his holiness, we may follow whither he calls), but because it greatly concerns his glory not to have any fellowship with wickedness and impurity. Wherefore he tells us that this is the end of our calling, the end to which we ought ever to have respect, if we would answer the call of God. For to what end were we rescued from the iniquity and pollution of the world into which we were plunged, if we allow ourselves, during our whole lives, to wallow in them? Besides, we are at the same time admonished, that if we would be regarded as the Lord's people, we must inhabit the holy city Jerusalem (Isaiah rev. 8, et alibi); which, as he hath consecrated it to himself, it were impious for its inhabitants to profane by impurity. Hence the expressions, "Who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? He that. 5:4). Come, then, and let them show me a more excellent system among philosophers, who think that they only have a moral philosophy duly and orderly arranged. They, when they would give excellent exhortations to virtue, can only tell us to live agreeably to nature. Scripture derives its exhortations from the true source,39[2] when it not only enjoins us to regulate our lives with a view to God its author to whom it belongs; but after showing us that we have degenerated from our true origin--viz. the law of our Creator, adds, that Christ, through whom we have returned to favour with God, is set before us as a model, the image of which our lives should express. What do you require more effectual than this? Nay, what do you require beyond this? If the Lord adopts us for his sons on the condition that our life be a representation of Christ, the bond of our adoption,--then, unless we dedicate and devote ourselves to righteousness, we not only, with the utmost perfidy, revolt from our Creator, but also abjure the Saviour himself. Then, from an enumeration of all the blessings of God, and each part of our salvation, it finds materials for exhortation. Ever.
4. This is the place to address those who, having nothing of Christ but the name and sign, would yet be called Christians. How dare they boast of this sacred name? None have intercourse with Christ but those who have acquired the true knowledge of him from the Gospel. The Apostle denies that any man truly has learned Christ who has not learned to put off "the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and put on Christ," (Eph. 4:22). They are convicted, therefore, of falsely and unjustly pretending a knowledge of Christ, whatever be the volubility and eloquence with which they can talk of the Gospel.. Let them, therefore, either cease to insult God, by boasting that they are what they are not, or let them show themselves not unworthy disciples of their divine Master. To doctrine in which our religion is contained we have given the first place, since by it our salvation commences; but it must be transfused into the breast, and pass into the conduct, and so transform us into itself, as not to prove unfruitful. If philosophers are justly offended, and banish from their company with disgrace those who, while professing an art which ought to be the mistress of their conduct, convert it into mere loquacious sophistry, with how much better reason shall we?
5. I insist not that the life of the Christian shall breathe nothing but the perfect Gospel, though this is to be desired, and ought to be attempted. I insist not so strictly on evangelical perfection, as to refuse to acknowledge as a Christian any man who has not attained it. In this way all would be excluded from the Church, since there is no man who is not far removed from this perfection, while many, who have made but little progress, would be undeservedly rejected. What then? Let us set this before our eye as the end at which we ought constantly to aim. Let it be regarded as the goal towards which we are to run. For you cannot divide the matter with God, undertaking part of what his word enjoins, and omitting part at pleasure. For, in the first place, God uniformly recommends integrity as the principal part of his worship, meaning by integrity real singleness of mind, devoid of gloss and fiction, and to this is opposed a double mind; as if it had been said, that the spiritual commencement of a good life is when the internal affections are sincerely devoted to God, in the cultivation of holiness and justice.. How little soever the success may correspond with our wish, our labour is not lost when to-day is better than yesterday, provided with true singleness of mind we keep our aim, and aspire to the goal, not speaking flattering things to ourselves, nor indulging our vices, but making it our constant endeavour to become better, until we attain to goodness itself. If during the whole course of our life we seek and follow, we shall at length attain it, when relieved from the infirmity of flesh we are admitted to full fellowship with God.

There was nothing better, in my opinion, on a crisp fall morning than that exact breakfast. Of course, I still make it for my family regularly, but I generally don't have any myself. I cringe at all that sugary syrup. Thankfully, Crazy Cups Coffee seems to get the memo, and has made a maple french toast flavored coffee that is...get this...
ZERO CALORIES!
What?! No, I'm not kidding.
A delicious medium roast coffee that tastes exactly like sweet cinnamon french toast with decadent homemade maple syrup, just like grandpa use to make. And the best part is not having to feel guilty afterwards. Go on, have more than one cup.
Crazy Cups is pretty good at matching desert, and sweet flavors and turning them into guilt free coffees. I admit to rarely having breakfast. I just can't force myself to eat so early in the morning. However, you better believe that I don't miss a morning coffee, so Crazy Cups variety of flavors from maple french toast to cinnamon bun, and churros, allows me to get the sweetness of breakfast foods and dessert in the morning right along with my coffee.

The Open Garden Network, announced on Monday at the CTIA trade show in Las Vegas, is software that lets devices and apps get online via a mesh network made up of ordinary consumer gadgets such as smartphones and tablets. Over Bluetooth Low Energy or Wi-Fi Direct, each link in the network connects to another participating device until it reaches one that's within range of a cell or a Wi-Fi access point.
Linking small, power-sipping devices to the Internet is one of the main challenges in IoT, an area that's likely to be a major focus of the annual U.S. mobile show. Both consumer wearables and enterprise machines and sensors are expected to make up much of the wireless universe in the next few years.
The first company taking advantage of the system is Phone Halo, which makes TrackR, tiny coin-sized tags that users can attach to something valuable in order to track its location via GPS. The TrackR tags don't have cellular or Wi-Fi radios because they would take up too much space and power, so they already use a concept like Open Garden's. Users who've tagged their things use a TrackR app to find out where they are. The tags communicate their GPS readings through other phones that have the TrackR app.
That's a big network, because there are 250,000 TrackR tags in use, according to the company. But with Open Garden Network, it's going to get bigger because TrackR devices will also be able to communicate through any phone equipped with FireChat, Open Garden's app for online and offline communication.
The Open Garden Network software could draw many more apps and IoT devices into that system. The more partners Open Garden signs up, the bigger and more useful the network would get. The users of all apps that take advantage of the Open Garden Network would become conduits for all the other apps and devices on that network.
The process is just beginning, said Christophe Daligault, Open Garden's chief marketing officer.
"The device space is new for us and we don't know quite yet who will be interested," Daligault said. "In terms of apps, it's anyone who wants to increase the connectivity time or user time."
App developers and device manufacturers can get into the network by using an Open Garden API (application programming interface) and licensing a software key from the company. Open Garden provides a software development kit for getting started. Individual users won't have to do any configuration or setup, Daligault said.
The company's approach is two-pronged: For IoT devices, it would offer indirect Internet access for things that couldn't otherwise get online. For mobile apps, it would give users access in more places so they can spend more time playing a game, chatting or doing other activities that require a connection. That extended online time could make the Open Garden Network a good deal for mobile operators, too, a pitch that the company is making to carriers at CTIA.
Mobile operators could incorporate the Open Garden Network API in their handset software to give subscribers better coverage, he said. When subscribers can't reach the carrier's nearest cell, they may be able to reach it via a string of Open Garden users in between. With Bluetooth Low energy, for example, each hop is about 100 feet (30 meters), but the network can make multiple hops, Daligault said. That could improve the subscriber experience at large events, where there may be many active devices but not enough cellular capacity.
However, the network isn't intended to be a panacea for overtaxed cells or poor coverage. It's designed to carry relatively small amounts of data, such as those GPS coordinates that TrackR devices send, rather than video streams or other heavy traffic, Daligault said.
Users who download an app that can connect to the Open Garden Network won't end up as the sole Internet link for a mob of people and use up a month's worth of data allowance on their behalf, Daligault said. When that user goes out of cell coverage, they'll get online through others and not be paying for any of the bits.
"You get as much as you give," Daligault said.

Life of Sir Isaac Newton
The following life is substantially a translation from that in the "Biographie Universelle," by M. Biot, the very learned French mathematician and natural philosopher; and to the kindness of this distinguished individual we feel deeply indebted, for allowing us to present this number to our readers. Those alterations only have been made, which we considered might render the treatise more adapted for the objects which the Society has in view.
Isaac Newton was born at Woolsthorpe, in Lincolnshire, on the 25th December, 1642 (O.S.) the year in which Galileo died. At his birth he was so small and weak that his life was despaired of. At the death of his father, which took place while he was yet an infant, the manor of Woolsthorpe, of which his family had been in possession several years, became his heritage. In a short time his mother married again; but this new alliance did not interfere with the performance of her duties towards her son. She sent him, at an early age, to the school of his native village, and afterwards, on attaining his twelfth year, to the neighbouring town of Grantham, that he might be instructed in the classics. Her intention, however, was not to make her son a mere scholar, but to give him those first principles of education which were considered necessary for every gentleman, and to render him able to manage his own estate. After a short period, therefore, she recalled him to Woolsthorpe, and began to employ him in domestic occupations. For these he soon showed himself neither fitted nor inclined. Already, during his residence at Grantham, Newton, though still a child, had made himself remarkable by a decided taste for various philosophical and mechanical inventions. He was boarded in the house of an apothecary, named Clarke, where, caring but little for the society of other children, he provided himself with a collection of saws, hammers, and other instruments, adapted to his size; these he employed with such skill and intelligence, that he was able to construct models of many kinds of machinery; he also made hour-glasses, acting by the descent of water, which marked the time with extraordinary accuracy. A new windmill, of peculiar construction, having been erected in the vicinity of Grantham, Newton manifested a strong desire to discover the secret of its mechanism; and he accordingly went so often to watch the workmen employed in erecting it, that he was at length able to construct a model, which also turned with the wind, and worked as well as the mill itself; but with this difference, that he had added a mouse in the interior, which he called the miller, because it directed the mill, and ate up the flour, as a real miller might do. A certain acquaintance with drawing was necessary in these operations; to this art, thought without a master, he successfully applied himself. The walls of his closet were soon covered with designs of all sorts, either copied from others, or taken from nature. These mechanical pursuits, which already implied considerable powers of invention and observation, occupied his attention to such a degree, that for them he neglected his studies in language; and, unless excited by particular circumstances, he ordinarily allowed himself to be surpassed by children of very inferior mental capacity. Having however, on some occasion, been surpassed by one of his class fellows, he determined to prevent the recurrence of such a mortification, and very shortly succeeded in placing himself at the head of them all.
It was after Newton had for several years cherished and, in part, unfolded so marked a disposition of mind, that his mother, having taken him home, wished to employ him in the affairs of her farm and household. The reader may easily judge that he had little inclination for such pursuits. More than once[1] he was sent by his mother on market-days to Grantham, to sell corn and other articles of farming produce, and desired to purchase the provisions required for the family; but as he was still very young, a confidential servant was sent with him to teach him how to market. On these occasions, however, Newton, immediately after riding into the town, allowed his attendant to perform the business for which he was sent, while he himself retired to the house of the apothecary where he had formerly lodged, and employed his time in reading some old book, till the hour of return arrived. At other times he did not even proceed so far as the town, but stopping on the road, occupied himself in study, under the shelter of a hedge, till the servant came back. With such ardent desire for mental improvement, we may easily conceive that his repugnance to rural occupations must have been extreme; as soon as he could escape from them, his happiness consisted in sitting under some tree, either reading, or modelling in wood, with his knife, various machines that he had seen. To this day is shewn, at Woolsthorpe, a sun-dial, constructed by him on the wall of the house in which he lived. It fronts the garden, and is at the height to which a child can reach. This irresistible passion, which urged young Newton to the study of science, at last overcame the obstacles which the habits or the prudence of his mother had thrown in his way. One of his uncles having one day found him under a hedge, with a book in his hand, entirely absorbed in meditation, took it from him, and discovered that he was working a mathematical problem. Struck with finding so serious and decided a disposition in so young a person, he urged Newton's mother no longer to thwart him, but to send him once more to pursue his studies at Grantham.
There he remained till he reached his eighteenth year, when he removed to Cambridge, and was entered at Trinity-College, in 1660. Since the beginning of the seventeenth century, a taste for the cultivation of mathematical knowledge had shown itself among the members of that University. The elements of algebra and geometry generally formed a part of the system of education, and Newton had the good fortune to find Dr. Barrow, professor; a man who, in addition to the merit of being one of the greatest mathematicians of his age, joined that of being the kindest instructor as well as the most zealous protector of the young genius growing up under his care.
Newton, in order to prepare himself for the public lessons, privately read the text books in advance, the better to follow the commentaries of the lecturer. These books were, Bishop Sanderson's Logic,[2] and Kepler's Treatise on Optics, from which it is evident the young learner must have made considerable progress in the elements of geometry when studying at Grantham. After Newton went to Cambridge, the process of the unfolding of his intellect, a subject so interesting in the study of the human mind, fortunately remains to us either described by himself or established in literary monuments, by which we are enabled accurately to trace it progress.
At this epoch, Descartes bore sway both in speculative and in natural philosophy. The authority of the metaphysical systems of his daring and fertile mind having succeeded to the empire which those of Aristotle had previously exercised, caused his method and his works to be adopted also in mathematics. Hence the geometry of Descartes was one of the first books that Newton read at Cambridge.
After Newton's persevering efforts, when reading alone, to make himself master of the elements of this science, explained so unconnectedly and imperfectly by other authors, he must have felt a lively pleasure on entering on the wide career that the French analyst was the first to open, and in which, having shown the connexion between algebraical equations and geometry, he discovers to us the use of that relation in solving, almost at sight, problems which, up to that time, had foiled the efforts of all the ancient and modern mathematicians. It is singular, however, that Newton, in his writings, has never mentioned Descartes favourably; and, on more than one occasion, has treated him with injustice.[3] He next proceeded, whenabout twenty-one years old, to read the works of Wallis, and appears to have taken peculiar delight in studying the remarkable treatise of this analyst, entitled Arithmetica infinitorum. It was his custom, when reading, to note down what appeared to him capable of being improved; and, by following up the ideas of Wallis, he was led to many important discoveries: for instance, Wallis had given the quadrature of curves, whose ordinates are expressed by any integral and positive power of (); and had observed, that if, between the areas so calculated, we could interpolate the areas of other curves, the ordinates of which constituted, with the former ordinates, a geometrical progression, the area of the curve, whose ordinate was a mean proportional between 1 and () would express a circular surface, in terms of the square of its radius. In order to effect this interpolation, Newton began to seek, empirically, the arithmetical law of the co-efficients of the series already obtained.[4] Having found it, he rendered it more general, by expressing it algebraically. He then perceived that this interpolation gave him the expression in series of radical quantities, composed of several terms; but, not blindly trusting to the induction that had conducted him to this important result, he directly verified it by multiplying each series by itself the number of times required by the index of the root, and he found, in fact, that this multiplication re-produced exactly the quantity form which it had been deduced. When he had thus ascertained that this form of series really gave the development of radical quantities, he was obviously led to consider that they might be obtained still more directly, by applying to the proposed quantities the process used in arithmetic for extracting roots. This attempt perfectly succeeded and again gave the same series, which he had previously discovered by indirect means; but it made them depend on a much more general method, since it permitted him to express, analytically, any powers whatever of polynomials, their quotients, and their roots; by operating upon and considering these quantities as the developments of powers corresponding to integral, negative, or fractional exponents. It is, in fact, in the generality and in the uniformity given to these developments in which the discovery of Newton really consists: for Wallis had remarked before him, with regard to monomial quantities, the analogy of quotients and roots, with integral powers, expressed according to the notation of Descartes; nay, more, Pascal had given a rule for forming, directly, any term of an expanded power of a binomial, the exponent being an integer. But whatever might be the merit of these observations, they were incomplete, and wanted generality, from not being expressed in an algebraical form. In fact, this step made by Newton was indispensable for discovering the development of functions into infinite series. Thus was found out the celebrated formula of such constant use in modern analysis, known by the name of the Binomial Theorem of Newton; and not only did he discover it, but he further perceived that there is scarcely any analytical research in which the use of it is not necessary, or at least possible. He immediately made a great number of the most important of these applications, solving, in this way, by series, with unexampled facility and exactness, questions which, up to that time, had not even been attempted, or of which solutions had been obtained only when the real difficulties of the case were removed by particular limitations. It was thus that he obtained the quadrature of the hyperbola and of many other curves, the numerical values of which he amused himself in computing to as many decimal places nearly as had previously been employed in the case of the circle alone: such pleasure did he take in observing the singular effect of these new analytical expressions, which, when capable of being determined exactly, stopped after a certain number of terms; and, in the opposite case, extended themselves indefinitely, while approximating more and more to the truth. Nor did he confine his application of these formulæ to the areas of curves and their rectification, but extended it to the surfaces of solids, to the determination of their contents, and the situation of their centres of gravity. To understand how this method of reducing into series could conduct him to such results, we must recollect that, in 1665, Wallis, in his Arithmetica infinitorum, had shown that the area of all curves may be found whose ordinate is expressed by any integral power of the abscissa; and he had given the expression for this area in terms of the ordinate. Now, by reducing into series the more complicated functions of the abscissa which represent the ordinates, Newton changed them into a series of monomial terms, to each of which he was able to apply the rule of Wallis. He thus obtained as many portions of the whole areas as there were terms, and by their addition obtained the total. But the far more extensive, and, in some respects, unlimited applications that Newton made of this rule, depended on a general principle which he had made out, and which consisted in the determining, from the manner in which quantities gradually increase, what are the values to which they ultimately arrive. To effect this, Newton regards them not as the aggregates of small homogeneous parts, but as the results of continued motion; so that, according to this mode of conception, lines are described by the movement of points, surfaces by that of lines, solids by that of surfaces, and angles by the rotation of their sides. Again — considering that the quantities so formed are greater or smaller in equal times, according as the velocity with which they are developed is more or less rapid, he endeavours to determine their ultimate values from the expression for these velocities, which he calls Fluxions, naming the quantities themselves Fluents. In fact, when any given curve, surface, or solid is generated in this manner, the different elements to which either compose or belong to it, such as the ordinates, the abscissæ, the lengths of the arcs, the solid contents, the inclinations of the tangent planes, and of the tangents, all vary differently and unequally, but nevertheless according to a regular law depending on the equation of the curve, surface, or solid under consideration.
Hence Newton was able to deduce from this equation the fluxions of all these elements, in terms of any one of the variables, and of the fluxion of this variable, considered as indeterminate; then, by expanding into series, he transformed the expression, so obtained, into finite, or infinite series of monomial terms, to which Wallis's rule became applicable: thus, by applying it successively to each, and taking the sum of the results, he obtained the ultimate value, i.e. the fluent of the element he had been considering. It is in this that the method of fluxions consists, of which Newton from that time laid the foundation; and which, eleven years later, Leibnitz again discovered, and presented to the world in a different form, that, namely, of the modern Differential calculus. It were impossible to enumerate the various discoveries in mathematical analysis, and in natural philosophy, that this calculus has given rise to; it is sufficient to remark, that there is scarcely a question of the least difficulty in pure of mixed mathematics that does not depend on it, or which could be solved without its aid. Newton made all these analytical discoveries before the year 1665, that is, before completing his twenty-third year. He collected and arranged them in a manuscript, entitled "Analysis per æquationes numero terminorum infinitas." He did not, however, publish, or even communicate it to any one, partly, perhaps, from a backwardness to attain sudden notoriety, though more probably from his having already conceived the idea of applying this calculus to the determination of the laws of natural phenomena, anticipating that the analytical methods which he had discovered would be to him instruments for working out the most important results. It is at least certain, that, satisfied with the possession of this treasure, he kept it in reserve, and turned his attention more closely towards objects of natural philosophy. At this time (1665), he quitted Cambridge to avoid the plague, and retired to Woolsthorpe. In this retreat he was able to abandon himself, without interruption, to that philosophical meditation which appears to have been essential to his happiness.
The following anecdote is related by Pemberton, the contemporary and friend of Newton. — Voltaire, in his 'Elements of Philosophy,' says that Mrs. Conduit, Newton's niece, attested the fact.
One day, as he was sitting under an apple-tree, (which is still shown) an apple fell before him; and this incidentawakening, perhaps, in his mind, the ideas of uniform and accelerated motion, which he had been employing in his method of fluxions, induced him to reflect on the nature of that remarkable power which urges all bodies to the centre of the earth; which precipitates them towards it with a continually accelerated velocity; and which continues to act without any sensible diminution at the tops of the highest towers, and on the summits of the loftiest mountains. A new idea darted across his mind. "Why," he asked himself, "may not this power extend to the moon, and then what more would be necessary to retain her in her orbit about the earth?" This was but a conjecture; and yet what boldness of thought did it not require to form and deduce it form so trifling an accident! Newton, we may well imagine, applied himself with all his energy to ascertain the truth of this hypothesis. He considered, that if the moon were really retained about the earth by terrestrial gravity, the planets, which move round the sun, ought similarly to be retained in their orbits by their gravity towards that body.[5] Now, if such a force exists, its constancy or variability, as well as its energy at different distances from the centre, ought to manifest itself in the different velocity of the motion in the orbit; and consequently, its law ought to be deducible from a comparison of these motions. Now, in fact, a remarkable relation does exist between them, which Kepler had previously found out by observation, namely, that the squares of the times of revolution of the different planets are proportional to the cubes of their distances from the sun. Setting out with this law, Newton found, by calculation, that the force of solar gravity decreases proportionally to the square of the distance; and it is to be observed that he could not have arrived at this result without having discovered the means of determining from the velocity of a body in its orbit, and the radius of the orbit supposed to be circular, the effort with which it tends to recede from the centre; because it is this effort that determines the intensity of the gravity, (to which, in fact, the effort is equal.) It is precisely on this reasoning, that the beautiful theorems on centrifugal force, published six years afterwards by Huygens, are founded; whence it is plain that Newton himself must necessarily have been acquainted with these very theorems. Having thus determined the law of the gravity of the planets towards the sun, he forthwith endeavoured to apply it to the moon; that is to say, to determine the velocity of her movement round the earth, by means of her distance as determined by astronomers, and the intensity of gravity as shown by the fall of bodies at the earth's surface. To make this calculation, it is necessary to know exactly the distance from the surface to the centre of the earth, expressed in parts of the same measure that is used in marking the spaces described, in a given time, by falling bodies at the earth's surface; for their velocity is the first term of comparison that determines the intensity of gravity at this distance from the centre, which we apply afterwards at the distance of the moon by diminishing it proportionally to the square of her distance. It then only remains to be seen, if gravity, when thus diminished, has precisely the degree of energy necessary to counteract the centrifugal force of the moon, caused by the observed motion in her orbit. Unhappily, at this time, there existed no correct measure of the earth's dimensions. Such as were to be met with, had been made only for nautical purposes, and were extremely imperfect. Newton, having no other resource but to employ them, found that they gave for the force that retains the moon in her orbit, a value greater by than that which results from her observed circular velocity. This difference, which would, doubtless, to any other person, have appeared very small, seemed, to his cautious mind a proof sufficiently decisive against the bold conjecture which he had formed. He imagined that some unknown cause, analogous, perhaps, to the vortices of Descartes,[6] modified, in the case of the moon, the general law of gravity indicated by the movement of the planets. He did not, however, on this account, wholly abandon his leading notion, but, in conformity with the character of his contemplative mind, he resolved not yet to divulge it, but to wait until study and reflection should reveal to him the unknown cause which modified a law indicated by such strong analogies. This took place in 1665-6. During that latter year, the danger of the plague having ceased, he returned to Cambridge, but he did not disclose his secret to any one, not even to his instructor, Dr. Barrow. It was not till two years afterwards, 1668, that Newton communicated to the latter, who was then engaged in publishing his lectures on Optics, certain theorems relating to the optical properties of curved surfaces, of which Barrow makes very honourable mention in his preface. Newton had now become a colleague of his former tutor, having been admitted master of arts the preceding year. At length in the same year (1668) an occurrence in the scientific world compelled him to declare himself. Mercator[7] printed and published, towards the end of this year, a book called Logarithmotechnia, in which he had succeeded in obtaining the area of the hyperbola referred to its asymptotes, by expanding its ordinate into a infinite series; this he did by means of common division, as Wallis had done in the case of fractions of the form : then, considering each term of this series separately, as representing a particular ordinate, he applied to it Wallis's method for curves, whose ordinates are expressed by a single term, and the sum of the partial areas so obtained, gave him the value of the whole area. This was the first example given to the world of obtaining the quadrature of a curve by expanding its ordinate into an infinite series. And it was also the main secret in the general method which Newton had invented for all problems of this nature. The novelty of the invention caused it to be received with general applause. Collins, a gentleman well known to science and philosophy at that time, hastened to send Mercator's book to his friend Barrow, who communicated it to Newton. The latter had no sooner glanced over it, than recognizing his own fundamental idea, he immediately went home, to find the manuscript; in which he had explained his own method, and presented it to Barrow; this was the treatise Analysis per æquationes numero terminorum infinitas. Barrow was struck with astonishment at seeing so rich a collection of analytical discoveries of far greater importance than the particular one which then excited such general admiration. Perhaps, too, he must have been still more surprised at their young author having been able to keep them so profoundly secret. He immediately wrote about them to Collins, who, in return, entreated Barrow to procure for him the sight of so precious a manuscript. Collins obtained his request, and happily, before returning the work, took a copy of it, which being found after his death, among his papers, and published in 1711, has determined beyond dispute, by the date which it bore, at what period Newton made the memorable discovery of expansion by series, and of the method of fluxions. It would have been natural to suppose that an interference with his own discoveries would at last have induced Newton to publish his methods; but he preferred still to keep them secret. "I suspected," says he, "that Mercator must have known the extraction of roots, as well as the reduction of fractions into series by division, or at least, that others, having learnt to employ division for this purpose, would discover the rest before I myself should be old enough to appear before the public, and, therefore, I began henceforward to look upon such researches with less interest."[8]
It were difficult to explain this reserve and indifference by the feelings of extreme modesty alone; but we may come near the truth by considering what were the habits of Newton, and by figuring to ourselves the new and extraordinary allurements of another discovery which he had just made, and which he already enjoyed in secret; for in general, the effort of thinking was with him so strong, that it entirely abstracted his attention from other matters, and confined him exclusively to one object. Thus we know that he never was occupied at the same time with two different scientific investigations. And we find,[9] even in the most beautiful of his works, the simple, yet expressive avowal of the disgust with which his most curious researches had always finally inspired him, from his ideas beingcontinually, and for a long time, directed to the same object. This might, perhaps, also have in part been caused by a discouraging conviction, that he would seldom be understood and followed in the chain of his reasoning; since others, in order to do so, must be as deeply immersed in the subject and as abstracted from other matters as himself. Be this as it may, when Mercator's work appeared, a new series of discoveries of a totally different nature had taken hold of Newton's thoughts.
In the course of 1666, he had accidentally been led to make some observations on the refraction of light through prisms. These experiments, which he had at first tried merely from amusement, or curiosity, soon offered to him most important results. They led him to conclude that light, as it emanates from radiating bodies, such as the sun, for instance, is not a simple and homogeneous substance, but that it is composed of a number of rays endowed with unequal refrangibility, and possessing different colouring properties. The inequality of the refraction undergone by these rays in the same body, when they enter at the same angle of incidence, enabled him to separate them; and thus, having them unmixed and pure, he was able to study their individual properties. But the breaking out of the plague, which in this year compelled him to take refuge in the country, having separated him from his instruments, and deprived him of the means of making experiments, turned his attention to other objects. More than two years elapsed before he returned to these researches, on finding himself about to be appointed lecturer on optics in room of Dr. Barrow, who in 1669 generously retired in order to make way for him. He then endeavoured to mature his first results, and was led to a multitude of observations no less admirable from their novelty and importance, than for the sagacity, address, and method, with which he perfected and connected them. He composed a complete treatise, in which the fundamental properties of light were unfolded, established, and arranged, by means of experiment alone, without any admixture of hypothesis, a novelty at that time almost as surprising as these properties themselves. This formed the text of the lectures he began in Cambridge 1669, when scarcely twenty-seven years old, and thus we see, from what we have related concerning the succession of his ideas, that the method of Fluxions, the theory of universal gravitation, and the decomposition of light, i.e. the three grand discoveries which form the glory of his life, were conceived in his mind before the completion of his twenty-fourth year.
Although the lectures of Newton on optics must inevitably in the end have given publicity to his labours on light, he still refrained from publishing, wishing probably to reserve to himself the opportunity of adding a complete analysis of certain curious properties, of which, as yet, he had had but a slight glimpse. We refer to the intermittences of reflection and refraction which take place in thin plates, and perhaps in the ultimate particles of all bodies. It was not till two years later, that he made known some of his researches, and soon afterwards he was induced to give them full publicity. In 1671 he had been proposed as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and was elected on the 11th of January, 1672. In order that he might be qualified to receive this distinction, the rules of the society required that he should declare himself desirous of becoming a Fellow, and he could not do so in a more honourable manner than by offering some scientific communication. He forwarded to them a description of a new arrangement for reflecting telescopes, which rendered them more commodious in use by diminishing their length without weakening their magnifying powers. With regard to this invention, in which Newton had been preceded, probably without knowing it, by Gregory the Scotch mathematician, and by a Frenchman of the name of Cassegrain, it is merely necessary to observe that the construction offers in practice some inconveniences, which cause it to be little used. Nevertheless, when he presented a model of it,[10] of his own construction, it made a great impression of his favour among the members of the society, to whom probably the construction of Gregory's telescope was not yet well known. The letter which Newton wrote to the society on this occasion, ends with the following characteristic expression: — "I am very sensible of the honour done me by the Bishop of Sarum, in proposing me Candidate, and which I hope will befurther conferred upon me by my election into the society, and if so, I shall endeavour to testify my gratitude by communicating what my poor and SOLITARY endeavours can effect towards the promoting philosophical design."[11] The favourable reception which this proposal met with, induced Newton two months afterwards to make to the Royal Society another much more important communication, viz. the first part of his labours on the analysis of light. We can easily imagine the sensation which so great and unexpected a discovery must have produced. The society requested of him, in the most flattering terms, permission to insert this beautiful Treatise in the Philosophical Transactions.[12] Newton accepted this speedy and honourable method of publication; and, in addressing his thanks to Oldenburg, their secretary, he says: — "It was an esteem of the Royal Society, for most candid and able judges in philosophical matters, encouraged me to present them with that discourse of light and colours, which since they have so favourably accepted of, I do earnestly desire you to return them my cordial thanks. I before thought it a great favour to be made a member of that honourable body, but I am now sensible of the advantage: for believe me, Sir, I do not only esteem it a duty to concur with them in the promotion of real knowledge, but a great privilege that, instead of exposing discourses to a prejudiced and censorious multitude, (by which means many truths have been baffled and lost,) I may with freedom apply myself to so judicious and impartial an assembly."[13] It is but fair to say, for the honour of the Royal Society, that it has always shown itself, more than any other, worthy of this noble testimony which the most illustrious of its members has rendered to its justice. But thought the suffrage and esteem of such a society may make amends for, yet they cannot prevent individual attacks. Newton himself was compelled to submit to the common destiny, which ordains that merit, and more particularly success, shall give rise to envy. By unveiling himself, he obtained glory, but at the price of his repose. At this period, Robert Hooke was a fellow of the Royal Society, a man of extensive acquirements, and of an original turn of thought, with great activity of mind and an excessive desire of renown. There were few departments of human knowledge to which he had not paid more or less attention: so much so, indeed, that it was hardly possible to find any subject of research upon which he did not profess to have original views; or to propose any new invention of which he did not claim the prior discovery. There was then the more opportunity of setting in action and of gratifying his jealous spirit, as all the physical and natural sciences were, at that time, mixed up with theoretical opinions; and there were few men then to be met with who could distinguish the difference between a vague perception and a precise idea — between a physical hypothesis and a law of nature rigorously demonstrated. Hooke himself was no exception to this remark; and unfortunately he was not sufficiently familiar with pure mathematics to make use of them as a means of calculation, either in proving or perfecting a theory. A thorough acquaintance with this instrument was the great advantage possessed by Newton, and which assured to his researches a precision and a certainty hitherto unknown in science. The investigation of the properties of light presented by him to the Royal Society, eminently possessed this rigorous character. It consisted in showing experimentally a certain number of physical properties, which were thus established as matters of fact without any admixture of hypothesis, and without requiring any previous knowledge in what the nature of light consisted. When the first feelings of surprise and admiration excited by this noble work had subsided, the Royal Society appointed three members to study the treatise fully, and to give an account of it. Hooke, being one of the number, undertook to draw up the report. Already on the occasion of Newton presenting his telescope, Hooke had announced that he possessed an infallible method of improving all sorts of optical instruments, so that[14] "whatever almost hath been in notion and imagination, or desired in optics, may be performed with great facility and truth." Nevertheless, he did not explain this method, but confined himself, in accordance with the conceits of his day, to masking it under the form of an anagram; of which, however, he appears not to have been able to produce the explanation, since neither he not any other person has ever realised these wonderful promises. His report on Newton's work was, if not of the same kind, yet conceived in the same spirit of personality: for, instead of discussing the new facts, singly, and as compared with the original experiments, he examined them only in relation to an hypothesis which he had formerly imagined, and which consists in regarding light not as an emanation of very small particles, but as the simple effect of vibrations excited and propagated in a very elastic medium. This conception of the nature of light may be in itself as true as any other, since that nature is still unknown to us; but, in order to place such an hypothesis on an equal footing with another hypothesis, shown by calculation to be consistent with experiment and observation, it ought to be detailed with exactness, and to be rigorously accordant with mathematical calculation. The first of these conditions was far from being fulfilled by Hooke, who substituted in its stead a sketch exceedingly vague, and materially contrary to experiment. He supposed, for instance, that there are only two colours essentially distinct, namely, the violet and the red, of which all the others are but mixtures.
With regard to the second condition, viz., an accordance with calculation, it was then far from possible to submit the system of undulations to rigorous mathematical investigation; since that is more than even, at the present time, those mathematicians have been able to accomplish who have been most occupied with the subject. To so vague a theory did Hooke refer, as a standard, the physical truths which Newton had discovered. He concluded by dictatorially allowing all that appeared to him to be reconcileable with his own hypothesis, and by advising him not to seek any other explanation of the facts.[15] Newton replied to this attack in a severe and decisive tone.[16] After refuting an error that Hooke had committed, in supposing the spherical aberration in reflectors greater than that in refracting lenses, he shows that Hooke had judged of the facts he had announced, not by means of the observations that supported them, but by their accordance or discordance with a previously conceived hypothesis; that this hypothesis was vague and unsatisfactory, and that, for his own part, he had not wished to support any hypothesis whatever, as in fact he had no need of one, but that he had only aimed at establishing the real properties of light upon actual observation. Finally, he adduced new experiments, confirming the results which he had already obtained, and refuted the inaccurate assertions of Hooke with respect to the possibility of reducing all colours to two simple ones; as well as his objections to the production of whiteness by the mixture of all the rays. This paper, which nearly completed Newton's investigation into the properties of light, was published by the Royal Society in the Philosophical Transactions of Nov. 1672. Hooke did not reply to this, but presuming, and with good reason, after Newton's first treatise, that such an experimentalist would soon be on the track of all that remained to be discovered concerning the physical properties of light, he hastened to present to the Royal Society several important observations on optics. Among them, we may remark a very precise and faithful account of the changeable colours that appear in the form of rings on soap bubbles, and in the thin plates of air included between pieces of glass pressed together; but without any determination of the physical law or measure even of the breadth and intervals of the rings. Two years afterwards (18th of March, 1674), he read another memoir, in which he detailed the fundamental phenomena of diffraction, which had been already discovered and described by Grimaldi;[17] but, what is still more remarkable, he then announced another principle, which, under the name of the principle of interferences, has since become one of such frequent and advantageous application.
This principle is, that colours are produced when two rays of white light arrive simultaneously at the eye, having directions so little different that this organ takes them to be one ray. We shall afterwards see that (as Hooke had tails he was obliged to enter in the discussion; and such was the disgust with which this inspired him, that he gave up his previous intention of printing his lectures on Optics with his treatise on Series, and determined to commit himself no more with the public.[18] "I was," he afterwards wrote to Leibnitz, "so persecuted with discussions arising from the publication of my theory of light, that I blamed my own imprudence for parting with so substantial a blessing as my quiet, to run after a shadow." It was, perhaps, the remembrance of these inconsiderate objections of Huygens, that afterwards inclined Newton to regard less favourably than he ought to have done, the law of double refraction in Iceland spar, discovered by this eminent mathematician, probably by experiment after Newton's own manner, though he presented it as a deduction from his own favourite system, and as a confirmation of it. It is easy to understand how much Newton must have been grieved by the opposition of so illustrious an adversary as Huygens, since he might at least have hoped to have been understood and appreciated by minds accustomed to the severity of mathematical investigations. Nevertheless, before quitting the lists, Newton wished finally to complete the account of the results which he had obtained, and of the views which he had formed on the nature of light. This was the object of a later paper addressed to the Royal Society.[19]anticipated) Newton was induced subsequently to occupy himself with these new phenomena; but, in the mean time, he was exposed to several absurd attacks upon his experimental analysis of light. Such, for instance, was that of a Jesuit named Pardies, who pretended that the elongation of the refracted image, whence Newton inferred the unequal refrangibility of the rays, was produced entirely by a difference in their original incidences on the first face of the prism: a supposition, the inaccuracy of which the most simple calculation would have been sufficient to show; and which Newton had previous refuted in his own Memoir. But still more foolish was the assertion of one Linus, a physician of Liege, who pretended never to have been able to produce by refraction through a prism an elongated image, but only a round and colourless one; whence he concluded that Newton had been led into error by the accidental passage of some bright cloud, which had elongated and coloured the image; adding also that he himself should not have been astonished had the image been elongated in the longitudinal direction of the prism; but that, without violating the rules of optics, it was impossible to imagine its elongation in the transverse direction. This was accompanied by several authoritative remarks on the improbability of what he called the new hypothesis, which Newton had imagined simply to be a statement of facts. These absurdities, as soon as presented, were printed in the Philosophical Transactions; and Newton was obliged to take the trouble to answer them methodically, to prevent their being accredited by that envy which showed itself so eager to receive them. He was compelled to reply to Huygens, who, though really a man of talent, made objections as unphilosophical nearly as the others, since he compared the properties discovered experimentally by Newton with an hypothesis of his own on the nature of light, in the same manner as Hooke had compared them with his hypothesis, and Pardies and Linus with the ancient ones. In vain did Newton reply that he neither advanced nor admitted any hypothesis whatever, but that his sole object was to establish and connect facts by means of the laws of nature. This severe and abstracted method of reasoning was then too little understood. It is scarcely conceivable into what de
We find there an experimental analysis of the colours observed in thin plates — phenomena, which, as we have said, had been previously pointed out and described by Hooke, but without his having either measured the spaces occupied by the colours, or determined the law which they followed. Newton first measured the spaces with admirable precision and nicety, and thence derived the physical laws by which all these results are connected with, and may be deduced from each other.
This treatise, united with his first paper on the analysis of Light, afterwards served as a base for the grand work published in 1704, under the name of Newton's Treatise on Optics; with this difference, however, that in the latter work the experimental investigations ofthe phenomena is more extensive and more strictly separated from all hypothesis. The new experiments with which Newton enriched it, relate principally to the colours observed in the thick plates of all bodies, when they are presented in a proper manner to the incident ray. Newton reduces them to the same laws as those of the phenomena in thin plates; and then considering these laws as established facts equally certain with the particular experiments form which they are deduced, yet far more universal, he unites them all in one general property of light, each peculiarity of which is characterized with such exactness, as to make the general property a pure expression for all the observed laws. The essence of this property is, that each particle of light, from the instant which it quits the radiating body whence it emanates, is subject periodically and at equidistant intervals, to a continual alternation of dispositions to be reflected from or to be transmitted through the surfaces of the diaphanous bodies it meets with; so that, for instance, if such a surface presents itself to the luminous particle during one of the alternations when the tendency to reflection is in force, which Newton has appropriately termed the fit of easy reflection, this tendency makes it yield more easily to the reflecting power of the surface; while, on the other hand, it yields with more difficulty when it is in the contrary phase, which Newton has termed the fit of easy transmission. We have here an admirable example of the universal application of scientific definitions when framed in strict accordance with experiment. For, though the term fits, inasmuch as it seems to imply a physical property, is applicable in its first intention to material particles only, and thus involves the assumption of the materiality of light, (a fact of which we may reasonably doubt, though Newton has never treated it as doubtful,) yet the characteristics of these fits are described in such exact conformity with experiment, that they would exist without any change, even were it discovered that light is constituted in any other manner — that it consists, for instance, in the propagation of undulations: such is the point of view in which Newton regards these fits in his Optics, 1704, limiting himself to deduce from them his profound inductions, on the intimate constitution of bodies, and on the cause which renders them apt to reflect or transmit a particular colour. But in his paper of 1675, he connected these properties with a very bold hypothesis, so general, that, from it, he deduced the nature of light and of heat, and the explanation of all the phenomena of combination or motion which appear to result from certain intangible and imponderable principles. As this hypothesis (mentioned only in the History of the Royal Society) is little known, and as it appears to have been constantly connected with Newton's thoughts on the constitution of the universe, we may here give a summary of it. We do this without the intention either of defending or combating it, but in order that the reader may see precisely in what the general views of Newton from this time forward consisted, and how, while they continued unchanged by lapse of time, he made a more or less explicit declaration of them according to circumstances. Newton, in the first place, excuses himself for proposing a conjecture as to the nature of light, declaring that he does not need one, and that the properties which he has discovered being physical facts, their being explicable or not by this or that hypothesis, could not in any degree add to or take away from their certainty;[20] "but," says he, "because I have observed the heads of some great virtuosos to run much upon hypotheses, I will give one which I should be inclined to consider as the most probable, if I were obliged to adopt one." He then admits, nearly as Descartes had previously done, the existence of a fluid imperceptible to our senses, which extends everywhere in space, and penetrates all bodies, with different degrees of density. He supposes this fluid to be more dense in bodies which contain in the same volume a less number of constituent material particles; he supposes also that the density of this fluid varies around each different body, and even around each constituent particle, increasing rapidly near their surface, and afterwards more slowly, though by insensible degrees, as the distance from the surface becomes greater. This fluid (which Newton calls ætherial medium or æther, in order to characterize by this denomination its extreme tenuity) he also considered as highly elastic; and consequently by the effort which it makes to spread, that it presses against itself, and against the material parts of other bodies, with an energy more or less powerful according to its actual density, and thus that all these bodies continually tend towards one another; the inequality of the pressure urging them always to pass from the denser into the rarer parts of the æther. Conformably to his opinion respecting the disposition of the æther around each body, and around each of its material constituent particles, he considered that the variations of its density between a body and a vacuum, or between one body and another neighbouring body, were not sudden and discontinuous, but gradual and progressive; and from being very rapid near the surfaces, where the nature or density of the matter instantaneously changes, they a little farther become so slow as soon to cease to be perceptible beyond certain limits of thickness inappreciable to our senses. If, then, this æther be disturbed or agitated, in any one point, by any cause whatever, producing a vibratory movement, this motion must transmit itself by undulations through all the rest of the medium, in the same way that sound it transmitted through air, but much more rapidly, by reason of the æther's greater elasticity; and, if those undulations, successively reiterated, happen to encounter in their passage the material particles forming the substance of any body, they will agitate them with considerable force, by the successive impressions, in precisely the same way that we see solid bodies, and sometimes even the whole mass of a large building, tremble under reiterated impulses of the weak undulations in the air, excited by the sounds of an organ, or by the rolling of a drum.
Now Newton does not suppose that light immediately results from the impression produced by these undulations on the nervous membrane of the retina, as Descartes and Hooke had previously done, and as, in general, has been done by all those who have followed the same system. The principal reason which Newton gives for rejecting this supposition is, that a motion excited in, and transmitted through, an elastic fluid which reposes on another fluid of a different density, does not seem capable of being reflected in the first fluid at their surface of common separation, without being in part transmitted into the second; whereas, in many cases, light, propagated into the interior of bodies, is totally reflected at their second surface, and again returns into their interior without the smallest part of it going out. Newton, therefore, admits that light consists of a peculiar substance different from the æther, but composed of heterogeneous particles, which, springing in all directions from shining bodies, with an excessive though measurable velocity, agitate the æther in their passage, and excite in it undulations; by the meeting of which, they become liable to be in their turn accelerated or retarded. Newton does not attempt to characterize the essence of these particles, but merely the faculty that he attributes to them of agitating the æther, and of being agitated by it; and finally he adds,[21] "those that will, may suppose it, multitudes of unimaginable small and swift corpuscles of various sizes springing from shining bodies at great distances one after another; but yet without any sensible interval of time; and continually urged forward by a principle of motion, which, in the beginning, accelerates them till the resistance of the ætherial medium equal the force of that principle, much after the manner that bodies let fall in water are accelerated, till the resistance of the water equals the force of gravity." Be this as it may, the independence of the particles of light and of æther being admitted, as well as their mutual reaction, Newton takes the case of a ray of light moving through a space in which the ætherial medium is composed of strata of unequal density; and applying to the particles of this ray the general principle established above, he concludes that they ought to be pressed, urged, or generally acted upon, so as to go from the denser to the rarer strata of æther; whence they must receive an accelerated velocity, if this tendency conspire with the proper motion of the ray; and a retarded velocity, if it be contrary to it; and generally a curvilinear deviation when the proper motion of the ray and the impression produced by the elastic medium are oblique to one another.
This is precisely what must happen when rays of light pass from one transparent homogeneous body into another, since the æther is there supposed to be of different densities; and the deviation of the rays takes place only near the common surface of the two bodies, where the sensible variation of density begins, whence results the phenomenonof refraction.[22] "Now," says Newton, "if the motion of the ray be supposed in this passage to be increased of diminished in a certain proportion, according to the difference of the densities of the ætherial mediums, and the addition or detraction of the motion be reckoned in the perpendicular from the refracting superficies, as it ought to be, the sines of incidence and refraction will be proportional, according to what Descartes has demonstrated." This explanation of refraction is exactly the same as Newton afterwards reproduced in the Principia, though without there pronouncing any opinion on the nature of the disturbing force. It is, however, probable, that in his Memoir he deduced it by simple induction, rather than by a mathematical investigation; for it does not appear that, at this epoch, he was acquainted with the calculation of curvilinear motions. It is, however, important to remark, that from this time he had formed a conception of the doctrine of universal gravitation; for he takes care to point out that the unequal density of the æther, at different distances from the surface of bodies, suffices to determine their mutual tendency towards one another; a consideration which he again brought forward in the Queries annexed to his Optics (in 1704), after he had discovered the laws of the system of the world. Nevertheless we may infer, that in 1675, he had not yet formed the idea of attractions at small distances, since, in his paper addressed to the Royal Society, he imagines that the ascent of liquids in capillary tubes is caused by the air being more rare in confined than in open spaces, and the more rare in proportion as the spaces are more confined. While in the Queries he attributes these phenomena to their true cause, viz. to the reciprocal attractions of the tubes and of the fluid; though, even at this later period, he did not know how to calculate their effect. It was reserved for LAPLACE to complete this investigation.
After having thus considered the simple transmission of rays in ætherial strata of unequal densities, Newton examines the modifications produced during this transmission, by their meeting with undulations originally excited in the æther itself, according as such undulations may favour or oppose the actual motion of luminous particles; and by this re-action he is enabled to explain the intermittances in reflection and refraction, which take place in thin plates. We may observe in his Optics, that he has never abandoned this idea; for though in that work he had maintained the most complete reserve with regard to the nature of light, yet, after characterizing the fits as a purely abstract physical property, he gives as a method of rendering it sensible, the same manner of conceiving it that he had given in his Memoir of 1675; the same idea is reproduced in several of the Queries, particularly in the 17th, and those following to the 24th, where Newton asks, as in the paper presented to the Royal Society, if this same æther be not also sufficient to produce universal gravitation, and even all the phenomena of animal motion? Finally, in his paper, he endeavours to apply the same principles to the inflections, undergone by rays of light on passing near the extremities of bodies; which he, in like manner, explains by variations in the density of the æther. It is always thus that he has represented these inflections, both in the Principia, printed in 1687, and in the Queries.
From these examples, taken together, we may see that Newton did not "several times change his ideas on light," as has been asserted by some writers, but that, always preserving the same opinion, he has explained it more or less fully, as different occasions demanded.
The phenomena of diffraction, how ever, were still too imperfectly known, and observed with too little detail for enabling Newton to see precisely whether they agreed or not with his hypothesis. We have reason to believe that, in order to study these properties, he then made a number of experiments, to be afterwards inserted at the end of the Optics; for he there introduces them as part of an investigation which he had formerly undertaken, but from which his thoughts were now so far estranged, that he had lost the taste for resuming it. These observations, like all his others, are presented as matters of fact, without relation to any system. When the hypothesis of Newton on the nature of light was presented, in 1675, to the Royal Society, Hooke, as usual, put in his claims to it. Newton, however, did not again waste his time and repose in a controversy on the subject, but contented himself with writing to Oldenburg (21st December), in order to makehim see the injustice of that jealous individual. He first clearly shows that his fundamental idea has nothing in common with that of Hooke, inasmuch as the latter supposes light to consist in the undulations themselves of the æther, transmitted to the organ of vision; while the light of Newton is a substance entirely distinct, which, thrown into the æther, impresses upon, or receives from it, peculiar motions, by means of which it acts upon us. "As to the observations of Hooke on the colours of thin plates, I avow," says Newton, "that I have made use of them, and thank him for the same; but he left me to find out and make such experiments about it, as might inform me of the manner of the production of those colours, to ground an hypothesis on; he having give no further insight into."[23] Happily this time the discussion proceeded no further; and Oldenburg had sufficient influence, as well as sufficient sense, to prevent its obtaining notoriety. From this time till the year 1679, four years afterwards, Newton communicated nothing to the Royal Society. Oldenburg, whose kindness had ever encouraged him, unfortunately died in this interval, and was succeeded in the secretaryship by Hooke, an appointment little likely to remove an apprehension of new disputes. We may imagine, however, that Newton did not remain idle; and, in fact, in this interval, it appears, he was principally occupied with astronomical observations. At last, 28th November, 1679,[24] he had occasion to write to Hooke about a System of Physical Astronomy, on which the Royal Society had asked his opinion. In his letter he proposed, as a matter deserving attention, to verify the motion of the earth by direct experiment, viz. by letting bodies fall from a considerable height, and then observing if they follow exactly a vertical direction; for if the earth turns, since the rotary velocity at the point of departure must be greater than that at the foot of the vertical, they will be found to deviate from this line towards the east, instead of following it exactly as they would do if the earth did not revolve. This ingenious idea being very favourably received, Hooke was charged to put it into effect. On reflection, Hooke immediately added the remark that wherever the direction of gravity is oblique to the axis of the earth's rotation, i.e. in all parts of the earth, except at the equator, bodies, in falling, change parallels, and approach the equator: so that in Europe, for instance, the deviation does not take place, rigorously speaking, to the east, but to the south-east of the point of departure. Hooke communicated this remark to Newton, who immediately recognised its correctness in theory; but, in addition to this, Hooke assured the Royal Society that, on repeating the experiment several times, he had actually found that the deviation took place constantly towards the south-east; an accordance which would appear very simple, if Hooke's remarks were merely theoretical; but which must appear very extraordinary if he intended to speak of an actual observed deviation reckoned form the foot of the vertical; for in this case, according to the formulæ of LAPLACE, the tendency to the south is of the second order, relative to the absolute deviation; and in Hooke's observations this very slight deviation must have been excessively difficult to ascertain, since his experiments were made in the open air. It was this, however, which led Newton to consider whether the elliptical motion of the planets could result from a force varying inversely as the square of the distance, and if so, under what circumstances such a result would ensue. In fact, in proposing to the Royal Society his curious experiment, he had considered the motion of the heavy body as determined by a force of constant intensity, and had concluded the trajectory to be a spiral,[25] doubtless, because he imagined the body to fall in a resisting medium, such as the air. Hooke, who for a long time had adopted the hypothesis of a force decreasing as the squares of the distance from the centre, replied that the trajectory ought not to be a spiral, but that in a vacuum it would be an excentric ellipse, which would change into an ovodial curve likewise excentric, if the medium were a resisting one. It is impossible exactly to ascertain how Hooke arrived at these results, for neither then, nor on any subsequent occasion, did he give a demonstration of them; though Halley and Sir Christopher Wren both eagerly pressed him to do so. We might imagine, not without some probability, that the elliptic movement of projectiles was, in his mind, a consequence of the hypothetical, though just, ideas he had formed on the physical cause of the planetary motions; for he attributed them to the existence of a gravitating force, proper to each celestial body, and acting round its centre, with an energy inversely proportional to the square of the distance; so that, in this system, the motion of projectiles round the centre of the earth ought to be elliptical round the sun. Hooke had, for some time, turned his thoughts to this kind of speculation; but not being a sufficiently profound mathematician, rigorously to deduce the nature of the force form the form of the orbits, or to show how this form resulted from the supposed law of attraction, he tried to determine its character by direct physical experiments, and actually to produce the motions which resulted from the law, by means of mechanical contrivances. On the 21st March, 1666, he communicated to the Royal Society certain experiments, which he had attempted, in order to determine whether the weight of a body undergoes any variation at different distances from the earth's centre, at the greatest altitudes or depths which can be attained. These experiments were made with too little precision to give results on which any reliance could be placed. Hooke himself perceived this, and proposed to employ the more delicate process of using a pendulum clock, and successively observing its rate at different heights. This first attempt, though imperfect, shows the object he had in view, which perhaps is more clearly seen in his own words. "Gravity, though it seems to be one of the most universal active principles in the world, and consequently ought to be the most considerable, yet has it had the ill fate to have been always, till of late, esteemed otherwise, even to slighting and neglect. But the inquisitiveness of this latter age hath begun to find sufficient arguments to entertain other thoughts of it. Gilbert began to imagine it a magnetical attractive power, inherent in the parts of the terrestrial globe. The noble Verulam also, in part, embraced this opinion; and Kepler (not without good reason) makes it a property inherent in all celestial bodies, — sun, stars, planets. This supposition we may afterwards more particularly examine; but first it will be requisite to consider, whether this gravitating or attracting power be inherent in the parts of the earth; and, if so, whether it be magnetical, electrical, or of some other nature distant from either. If it be magnetical, any body attracted by it ought to gravitate more, when nearer to its surface, than when further off.[26]"
Two months afterwards, Hooke made before the Royal Society another experiment, which, as he himself observed, without being an exact representation of the planetary orbits, afforded an example, at that time new and remarkable, of a curvilinear motion produced by the combination of a primitive impulse with an attracting power emanating from a centre. He suspended from the ceiling of a room a long wire, to the end of which was attached a ball of wood, to represent a planetary body. On removing this pendulum from the vertical, and giving it a lateral impulse, perpendicular to the plane of deviation, it is acted on by two forces, of which one is the impulse itself, and the other terrestrial gravity, of which the effort when decomposed perpendicularly to the wire, tends always to bring the body back to the vertical. Now when the lateral impulse was nothing, the ball clearly described a plane orbit, viz. that of its free oscillation; if the impulse, without being nothing, were still very weak, the trajectory became a very much elongated ellipse, having its major axis in the plane of oscillation; with a stronger impulse, a more open ellipse was obtained, which, at a particular point, became an exact circle; and lastly, still stronger impulses produced ellipses, whose major axes were no long parallel with, but were perpendicular to the place of free oscillation. Thus these different curves were seen to be produced and to be transformed into eachother, by merely changing the relative energies of the two forces (the one impulsive, and the other central) which acted on the pendulum. These ellipses, however, differed much from the planetary ellipses, inasmuch as the central force produced by the decomposition of gravity is constantly directed towards the centre of the ellipse, and is directly proportional to the distance of the body from that centre; whereas, in the planetary orbits, the central force is constantly directed towards one of the foci of the ellipse, and is reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance of the body from that point. Notwithstanding this fundamental distinction, the experiment of Hooke was important and useful, as it gave a perceptible example of the composition of forces. Eight years later, in 1674, Hooke presented the whole of his ideas in a much more explicit and complete manner, at the end of a dissertation, entitled, "An Attempt to prove the Motion of the Earth from Observations."[27] "I shall," says he, "hereafter explain a system of the world, differing in many particulars from any yet known, answering in all things to the common rules of mechanical motions. This depends upon three suppositions: — first, that all celestial bodies whatsoever have an attraction or gravitating power towards their own centres, whereby they attract not only their own parts and keep them from flying from them, as we may observe the earth to do, but that they do also attract all the other celestial bodies that are within the sphere of their activity, and consequently, that not only the sun and moon have an influence upon the body and motion of the earth, and the earth upon them, but that Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn also, by their attractive powers, have a considerable influence upon its motion, as in the same manner the corresponding attractive power of the earth hath a considerable influence upon every one of their motions also. The second supposition is this,. The third supposition is, that those attractive powers are so much the more powerful in operating, by how much the nearer body wrought upon is to their own centres. Now what these several degrees are I have not yet experimentally verified; but it is a notion which, if fully prosecuted, as it ought to be, will mightily assist the astronomers to reduce all the celestial motions to a certain rule, which I doubt will never be done true without it. He that understands the nature of the circular pendulum and the circular motion will easily understand the whole ground of this principle, and will know where to find directions."
Without lessening the credit due to the distinct expression of such remarkable ideas, it is proper to observe, that we find in Hooke's work no measured result. We do not allude only to the law of force, which is here entirely omitted: we have said that Hooke supposed it to be reciprocal to the square of the distance; but others before him, and among them Bouillaud,[28] had established the same supposition, on simple metaphysical considerations. Halley again did the same, after Hooke and Bouillaud. We have a convincing proof that Hooke arrived at this conclusion in no other way, from his saying that he had not yet experimentally verified the law of decrease in the attracting force; for he would not have thus expressed himself if he had discovered this law directly, by applying the theorems of Huygens on centrifugal forces to the observed orbits of the planets; for in this case the experiment would have been already made, and the law of the squares, thus obtained, would have needed no other verification. The generalization of the idea of gravity, and its extension to all celestial bodies, decreasing in intensity according to the distance, was formallyexpressed by Borelli[29] in 1666, in his work on the Satellites of Jupiter; and not only did he announce it as a general principle, but he explained very clearly how the planets may be retained and suspended in empty space round the sun, in the same manner as the satellites round their planets, by the action of a power continually and exactly balanced by the centrifugal force caused by their rotation, without having recourse either to the solid heavens of Aristotle, or to the vortices of Descartes. Borelli even endeavoured to deduce from this combination of forces the elliptical motions of the satellites, and the inequalities in their motions, which he considered as being partly produced by the secondary action of the sun; and though, from his being unacquainted both with the law of this force at different distances, and with the Theorems on Central Forces, published by Huygens six years afterwards, he was, of course, unable rigorously to establish these deductions; yet there was much merit in being the first to guess and perhaps to indicate the possibility of doing so. Newton also, we shall presently see, attributes to Borelli the honour of having first formed the idea of extending the principle of gravitation, and of applying it to the planetary motions; and Huygens renders him the same justice in his Kosmotheoros,[30] where he mentions these happy perceptions, immediately before speaking of the demonstrations of Newton. It is not then by any means impossible that Hooke might have been conducted to the same thoughts by similar, that is by purely physical considerations; and we shall presently see reasons that render this conjecture extremely probable. However, in whatever manner he formed these opinions, it is clear that in 1679, he considered them as undoubtedly correct; for, in writing to Newton on the motion of projectiles, he represents the eccentric ellipse as the consequence of a force reciprocal to the squares of the distances from the centre of the earth. This remarkable relation could not fail of striking a mind which had so long and so constantly studied the motions of the heavens. Newton as we have already said, hastened to examine this result, by means of mathematical calculations, and discovered its truth; that is to say, he found that an attractive force, emanating from a centre, and acting reciprocally to the squares of the distances, necessarily compels the body on which it acts, to describe an ellipse, or in general a conic section, in one of whose foci the centre of force resides. The motions produced by such force exactly resemble the planetary motions, both in regard to the form of the orbit and the velocity of the body at each point. This was evidently the secret of the system of the world; but it still remained to account for the singular discordance which the moon's motion had offered to Newton, when, in 1665, he had wished to extend to her the earth's gravity diminished according to this law. Hence it was that, notwithstanding his inference was confirmed by other inductions, he abstained from publishing any thing upon the subject. Three years afterwards, however, (in June, 1682,) Newton being present at a meeting of the Royal Society, in London, the conversation turned on a new measurement of a terrestrial degree, recently executed in France, by Picard, and much credit was given to the care taken in rendering it exact. Newton, having noted down the length of the degree obtained by Picard, returned home immediately, and taking up his former calculation of 1665, began to recompute it from the new data. Finding, as he advanced, the manifest tendency of these numbers to produce the long wished for results, he suffered so much nervous excitement, that becoming at length unable to go on with the calculation, he entreated one of his friends to complete it for him. This time the agreement of the computed with the observed result was no longer doubtful. The force of gravity at the earth's surface, as determined by experiments on falling bodies, when applied to the moon, after being diminished proportionally to the square of the distance from the centre of the earth, was found to be very nearly equal to the centrifugal force in the moon, as concluded from its distance and angular velocity obtained by observation. The small difference which still existed between the two results, was in itself a new proof of exactness; for if we suppose an attractive power to emanate from all the celestial bodies inversely proportional to the squares of their distances from the bodies which they attract, the motion of the moon ought not only to depend upon its gravity towards the earth, but also to be influenced by the action of the sun; for this effect, though exceedingly weakened by the distance, ought not to be wholly imperceptible in the result.
Thus Newton ceased to doubt; and after having been, during so many years, kept in suspense about this eminently important law, he had no sooner recognized its truth, than he penetrated instantly to its most remote consequences, pursued them all with a vigour, a perseverance, and a boldness of thought, which, till that time, had never been displayed in science. Indeed it seems hardly probable that it will, at any future time, be the destiny of another human being to demonstrate such wonderful truths as these; that all the parts of matter gravitate towards one another, with a force directly proportional to their masses, and reciprocally proportional to the squares of their mutual distances; that this force retains the planets and the comets round the dun, and each system of satellites around their primary planets; and that, by the universally communicated influence which it establishes between the material particles of all these bodies, it determines the nature of their orbits, the forms of their masses, the oscillations in the fluids which cover them, and, in fine, their smallest movements, either in space or in rotation upon their own axes, and all conformably to the actually observed laws. The finding of the relative masses of the different planets, the determination of the ratio of the axes of the earth, the pointing out the cause of the precession of the equinoxes, and the discovery of the force exercised by the sun and the moon in causing the tides, were the sublime objects which unfolded themselves to the meditations of Newton, after he had discovered the fundamental law of the system of the universe. Can we wonder at his having been so much excited as not to have been able to complete the calculation which was leading him to a conviction that the discovery was achieved?
It was now that he must have experienced intense satisfaction at having so profoundly studied the manner in which physical forces act, and at having sought by so many experiments to comprehend, and exactly to measure their different effects. More particularly must he have been delighted at having created that new calculus, by means of which he was enabled to developr the most complicated phenomena, to bring to light the simple elements of motion, and thus to obtain the forces themselves from which the phenomena result; and finally, to re-descend from these forces to the detail of all their effects: for, with equal talent, had he not possessed this instrument of investigation, the complete unfolding of his discovery would have been impossible. But, possessing the means, he had only to apply them; and thus he saw the constant object of his hope attained. Henceforward, he devoted himself entirely to the enjoyment of these delightful contemplations; and during the two years that he spent in preparing and developing his immortal work, Philosophiæ naturalis Principia Mathematica, he lived only to calculate and to think. Oftentimes lost in the contemplation of these grand objects, he acted unconsciously: his thoughts appearing to preserve no connexion with the ordinary concerns of life. It is said that, frequently on rising in the morning, he would sit down on his bedside, arrested by some new conception, and would remain for hours together, engaged in tracing it out, without dressing himself. He would even have neglected to take sufficient nourishment, had be not been reminded by others of the time of his meals.[31]
It was only by the uninterrupted efforts of a solitary and profound meditation, that even Newton was able to unfold all the truths he had conceived, and which were but so many deductions from his great discovery. We may learn from his example, on what severe conditions even the most perfect intellect is able to penetrate deeply into the secrets of nature, and to enlarge the bounds of human attainments. For himself, he well knew, and willingly confessed, the inevitable necessity of perseverance andconstancy in the exercise of his attention, in order to develop the power of thought. To one who had asked him on some occasion, by what means he had arrived at his discoveries, he replied, "By always thinking unto them;" and at another time he thus expressed his method of proceeding. "I keep the subject constantly before me, and wait till the first dawnings open slowly by little and little into a full and clear light." Again, in a letter to Dr. Bentley, he says, "If I have done the public any service this way, it is due to nothing but industry and patient thought." With such tastes and habits, the complete command of his own time, and of his own ideas, was his highest enjoyment. Thus notwithstanding the importance of the results he had obtained, Newton was not eager to establish a title to them by publication, and perhaps he would have even longer delayed giving them to the world had an accidental circumstance not induced him to do so. About the beginning of 1684, Halley, one of the greatest of the English astronomers, and at the same time, one of the most enlightened and active minds that have ever cultivated science, formed the idea of employing the Theorems of Huygens on central forces, to determine the tendency in the different planets to recede from the sun, by virtue of their revolutions about that body, their orbits being considered as circular. From the ratios discovered by Kepler between the times of these revolutions, and the major axes of the orbits, he recognized these tendencies to be reciprocally as the square of the distances of each planet from the sun, so that the attraction which this luminary exerts to keep them in their places, must also vary according to the same law. This was precisely the idea that Newton had conceived in 1666, and from which he had drawn the same consequence. But there was yet a long way from this, to the rigorous calculation of curvilinear motions when the law of the force is given. Halley perceived the difficulty of this step, and after having in vain endeavoured to remove it, he consulted Hooke, at Sir Christopher Wren's house, without, however, receiving any light on the subject, although Hooke had boasted before them both that he had completely resolved this grand question. At last, impatient to see an idea unfolded, which appeared to him so fertile in consequences, Halley went to Cambridge in 1692, purposely to confer with Newton on the subject. It was then that Newton showed to him a Treatise on Motion, in which Halley found the desired solution. This treatise, with some additions, afterwards formed the two first books of the Principia. It would appear that, at this time, Newton had already introduced, and explained some parts of it, in his lectures at Cambridge. Halley, delighted at seeing his hopes realized, requested Newton to confide to him a copy for insertion in the registers of the Royal Society, in order to secure to him the honour of so important a discovery. Although Newton had an extreme repugnance to expose himself in the arena of literary intrigue, where he had, on a former occasion, wasted his time, and sacrificed his tranquillity, Halley, by repeated entreaties, at length succeeded in his object. On returning to London, Halley announced his success to the Royal Society, who repeated the request by means of Aston, at that time their secretary. But, though Newton kept his word to Halley, personally, by sending him a copy of his treatise, he did not then wish it to be communicated, having still many things to complete.[32] It was not till the following year, that Dr. Vincent presented, in Newton's name, this work, which was destined to make so great a revolution in science. Newton dedicated it to the Royal Society, who showed itself able to appreciate such an honour. It decided that the work should be printed immediately at its own expense, and addressed to the author, by Halley, a letter of thanks expressed in the most honourable terms.
Hooke, who probably had for some time past conceived in his mind similar ideas, without having been able to bring them to perfection, had no sooner understood the object of Newton's treatise, and heard of the admiration with which it was received, than he claimed for himself the priority of the discovery of the law of attraction varying inversely as the square of the distance. His reclamation was so violent, that Halley thought it necessary to notice it in his official letter to Newton, and to say that Hooke expected Newton to mention in his preface, that the priority was due to him. We will here quote the answer ofNewton[33], (dated Cambridge, 26th June, 1686,) especially as it will enable us to trace more clearly the progress and development of his ideas throughout this important research.
 Christopher Wren knew the duplicate proportion when I gave him a visit; and then Mr. Hooke, by his book Cometa, written afterwards (1678), not to reach accurately enough down so low; and therefore in the doctrine of projectiles never used it, nor considered the motion of the heavens, and consequently Mr. Hooke could not, from my letters, which were about projectiles, and the regions descending hence to the centre, conclude me ignorant of the theory of the heavens. That what he told me of the duplicate proportion was erroneous, namely that it reaches down from hence to the centre of the earth — that it is not candid to require me now to confess myself in print then ignorant of the duplicate proportion in the heavens, for not about me so well at that time. That, by the same reason, he concluded me ignorant of the rest of that theory I had read before in his books. That, in one of my papers, writ (I cannot say what year, but I am sure some time before I had any correspondence with Mr. Oldenburg, and that's above fifteen years ago) the proportion of the forces of the planets to the sun reciprocally duplicate to their distances from him, and the proportion of our gravity to the moon's conatus recedendi a centro terræ is calculated, though not accurately enough. — That, when Huygenius put out his treatise de Horologio Oscillatorio, a copy being presented to me, in my letter of thanks to him I gave those rules in the end thereof a particular commendation for their usefulness in computing the forces of the moon from the earth, and the earth from the sun, in determining a problem about the moon's phase, and putting a limit to the parallax, which shews that I had then my eye upon the forces of the planets arising from their circular motion, and understood it; so that while after, when Mr. Hooke propounded the problems solemnly in the end of his Attempt to prove the motion of the earth, if I had not known the duplicate proportion before, I could not but have found it now. Between ten and eleven years ago, there sake not there expressed) can be no other than reciprocally duplicate of the distance from the centre; and I hope I shall not be urged to declare in print that I understood not the obvious mathematical conditions of my own hypothesis; but grant I received it afterwards from Mr. Hooke, yet have I as great a right to it as to the ellipsis. For as Kepler knew the orb to be not circular but oval, I guessed it to be elliptical; so Mr. Hooke, without knowing what I have found out since his letters to me, can know no more but that the proportion was duplicate quam proxime at great distances form the centre, and only guessed it to be so accurately, and guessed amiss in extending that proportion down to the very centre; whereas Kepler guessed right at the ellipsis, and so Hooke found less of the proportion than Kepler did of theellipse, there is so strong an objection against the accurateness of this proportion, that without my demonstrations, to which Hooke is yet a stranger, it cannot be believed by a judicious philosopher to be anywhere accurate. And so, in stating this business, I do pretend to have done for the proportion as for the ellipse, and to have as much right to the one from proportions I have since thought I found out last winter. The third I now design to suppress. Philosophy is such an impertinently litigious lady, that a man had as good be engaged in law-suits, as have to do with her. I found it so formerly, and now I am no sooner come near her again, but she gives me warning. The two first books, without the third, will not bear so well the title of Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica; and, therefore, I had altered it to this, De Motû corporum libri duo; but, upon second thoughts, I retain the former title, 'twill help the sale of the book, which I ought not to diminish now 'tis yours."
Newton then adds, in a postscript, "Since my writing this letter, I am told by one who had it from another lately present at one of your meetings, how that Mr. Hooke should make a great stir, pretending I had all from him, and desiring they would see that he had justice done him. This carriage towards me is very strange and undeserved; so that I cannot forbear in stating the point of justice, to tell you further that he has published Borelli's hypothesis in his own name; and the asserting of this to himself, and completing it as his own, seems to me the ground of all the stir he makes. Borelli did something and wrote modestly. He has done nothing, and yet written in such a way, as if he knew, and had sufficiently hinted all but what remained to be determined by the drudgery of calculations and observations, excusing himself from that labour, by reason of his other business; whereas he should rather have excused himself by reason of his inability – for it is very those that went before. Much after the same manner were his letters writ to me, telling me that gravity in descent from hence to the centre of the earth was reciprocally in a duplicate ratio of the altitude — that the figure described by projectiles in that region would be an ellipsis, and that all the motions of the heavens were thus to be accounted for; and this he did in such a way, as if he had found out all, and knew it most certainly. And upon this information, I must now acknowledge, in print, I had all from him, and so did nothing myself but drudge in calculating, demonstrating, and writing upon the inventions of this great man; and yet, after all, the first of these three things he told me is false, and very unphilosophical; the second is as false; and the third was more than he knew, or could affirm me ignorant of, buy anything that passed between us in our letters. Nor do I understand by what right he claims it as his own; for as Borelli wrote long before him, that, by a tendency of the planets towards the sun, like that of gravity or magnetism, the planets would move in ellipses: so Bullialdus wrote, that all force respecting the sun as its centre, and depending upon matter, must be in a reciprocally duplicate ratio of the distance from the centre, and used that very argument for it, by which you, Sir, in the last Transactions, have proved this ratio in gravity."
The remainder of this letter offering no other historical details, we will not continue the quotation; but the extremely curious reply of Halley to Newton is well worthy of attention. It is dated 29th June, 1686. Halley begins by encouraging Newton not to heed the effects of Hooke's expostulations with the Royal Society, and then continues,"According to your desire, I waited upon Sir C. Wren, to inquire of him, if he had the first notion of the reciprocal duplicate proportion from Mr. Hooke? his answer was, that he himself, very many years since, had had his thoughts upon making out the planet's motions by a composition of a descent towards the sun and an impressed motion; but that at length he gave over, not finding the means of doing it. Since which time Mr. Hooke had frequently told him that he had done it, and attempted to make it out to him, but that he never was satisfied that his demonstrations were cogent. And this I know to be true, that in January, 168, I having, from the sesquialterate proportion of Kepler, concluded that the centripetal force decreased in the proportion of the squares of the distance reciprocally, came on Wednesday to town, from Islington, where I met with Sir C. Wren and Mr. Hooke, and falling in discourse about it, Mr. Hooke affirmed, that upon that principle all the laws of the celestial motions were to be demonstrated, and that he himself had done it. I declared the ill success of my attempts; and Sir Christopher, to encourage the inquiry, said, that he would give Mr. Hooke, or me, two months time to bring to him a convincing demonstration thereof; and besides the honour, he of us that did it should have from him a present of a book of forty shillings. Mr. Hooke then said he had it, but that he would conceal it for some time, that others, trying and failing, might know how to value it, when he should make it public. However, I remember that Sir Christopher Wren was little satisfied that he could do it; and though Mr. Hooke then promised to show it to him, I do not find that, in that particular, he has been so good as his word. The August following, when I did myself the honour to visit you, I then learned the good news, that you had brought this demonstration to perfection, and you were pleased to promise me a copy thereof, which I received with great satisfaction; and thereupon took another journey to Cambridge, on purpose to confer with you about it, since which time it has been entered upon the register-books of the society. Mr. Hooke, according to the philosophically ambitious temper he is of, would, had he been master of a like demonstration, no longer have concealed it, the reason he told Sir Christopher and me now ceasing. But now he says that it is but one small part of an excellent system of nature; which he has conceived but has not yet completely made out; so that he thinks not fit to publish one part without the other. But I have plainly told him, unless he produce another demonstration, and let the world judge of it, neither I nor any one else can believe it. After the meeting of the Royal Society, at which your book was presented, being adjourned to the Coffee-house, Mr. Hooke did there endeavour to gain belief, that he had some such things by him, and that he gave you the first hint of this invention; but I found they were all of opinion that nothing thereof appearing in print, nor on the books of the Society, you ought to be considered as the inventor. And if in truth he knew it before you, he ought not to blame any one but himself, for having taken no more care to secure a discovery which he puts so much value on." Halley concludes, by conjuring Newton, in the name of science, not to suppress the third volume through disgust at the conduct of an envious rival. Happily he succeeded, and Newton has, in a scholium,[34] generously mentioned Wren, Hooke, and Halley, as having all three recognized in the celestial motions the existence of an attraction reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance.
Newton's Principia appeared complete in 1687. We may form some idea of the novelty and profundity of the discoveries which it contained, on learning that, when it was first published, not more than two or three among Newton's contemporaries were capable of understanding it; that Huygens himself, a man whose mind was particularly suited to appreciate its merit, only in part adopted the idea of gravitation, and that merely as regarded the heavenly bodies, while he rejected its influence between the separate particles of matter — being preoccupied by the hypothetical ideas he had formed respecting the cause of gravity; that Leibnitz, perhaps through rivalry, or perhaps by a prepossession in favour of his own metaphysical system, completely mistook the beauty and the certainty of the method employed by Newton in this work, and even went so far as to publish a dissertation, in which he endeavoured to demonstrate the same truths on different principles;that even many years after the publication of the Principia, several most profound mathematicians (John Bernoulli, for instance) opposed it, and that Fontentelle, though in advance of his age on most subjects of philosophy, expressed somewhat more than doubts concerning the law of attraction, and persisted, during his whole life, in upholding the vortices of Descartes; and in fine, that more than fifty years elapsed before the great physical truth contained and demonstrated in the Principia was, we do not say followed up and developed, but even understood by the generality of learned men. Whatever difficulty, however, the just appreciation of such a work may present, we can here give a brief account of it with entire confidence, by translating the words of that illustrious man, whose genius has so much contributed to Newton's glory, in having by his own discoveries subjected all the movements of the celestial bodies to the law of universal gravitation. After having exhibited him as setting out from the laws of Kepler, in order to discover the nature and the law of the force that governs the motions of the planets and the satellites in their orbits, and afterwards generalizing this idea according to the phenomena that presented themselves until he had ascended to the certain and mathematical knowledge of universal gravitation, "Newton," says LAPLACE,[35] "having arrived at this point, saw all the great phenomena of the universe flow from the principle he had discovered. By considering gravity at the surface of the heavenly bodies as the result of the attractions of all their particles, he discovered this remarkable and characteristical property of a law of attraction reciprocal to the square of the distance, namely, that two spheres formed of concentric layers, and with densities varying according to any law whatever, attract each other mutually, as if their masses were united at their centres. Thus the bodies of the solar system act upon each other, and upon the bodies placed at their surfaces, very nearly as if they were so many centres of attraction — a result which contributes to the regularity of their movements, and which made this illustrious mathematician recognize the gravity of the earth in the force that retains the moon in her orbit. He proved that the earth's movement in rotation must have flattened it at the poles; and he determined the laws of gravitation in the degrees of the meridian, and in the force of gravity at the earth's surface. He saw that the attractions of the sun and moon excite and maintain in the ocean those oscillations which are there observed under the name of tides. He recognized several inequalities in the moon's motion and the retrograde motion of her nodes to be owing to the action of the sun. Afterwards, considering the excess of matter in the terrestrial spheroid at the equator, as a system of satellites adhering to its surface, he found that the combined actions of the sun and of the moon tend to cause a retrogradation, in the nodes of the circles they describe round the axis of the earth; and that the sum of these tendencies being communicated to the whole mass of the planet, ought to produce in the intersection of its equator with the ecliptic that slow retrogradation known by the name of the precession of the equinoxes. The true cause of this great phenomenon could not have even been suspected before the time of Newton, since he was the first who made known the two leading facts on which it depends. Kepler himself, urged by an active imagination to explain every thing by hypothesis, was constrained to avow in this instance the failure of his efforts. But, with the exception of the theory of the elliptical motions of the planets and comets, the attraction of spheres, the ratio of the masses of the planets accompanied by satellites to that of the sun, all the other discoveries respecting the motions and figures of the heavenly bodies were left by him in an incomplete state. His theory of the figures of the planets is limited, by supposing them to be homogeneous. His solution of the problem of the precession of the equinoxes, though very ingenious, and notwithstanding the apparent agreement of its result with observations, is defective in many particulars. Among the numerous perturbations in the motions of the heavenly bodies, he has only considered those of the moon, the greatest of which, viz. evection, has wholly escaped his researches. Newton has well established the existence of the principle he had the merit of discovering; but the development of its consequences and advantages has been the work of the successors of this great mathematician. The imperfection of the infinitesimal calculus when first discovered, did not allow him completely to resolve the difficult problems which the theory of the universe offers; and he was oftentimes forces to give mere hints, which were always uncertain till confirmed by rigorous analysis. Notwithstanding these unavoidable defects, the importance and the generality of his discoveries respecting the system of the universe, and the most interesting points of natural philosophy, the great number of profound and original views which have been the origin of the most brilliant discoveries of the mathematicians of the last century, which were all presented with much elegance, will insure to the Principia a lasting preeminence over all other productions of the human mind."
The great results that Newton has amassed in the Principia are almost all presented in a synthetical form, like that used in the writings of the ancients. Nevertheless we may assert, that he did not discover them by means of synthesis, which is neither sufficiently easy of application, nor sufficiently fertile in results to be employed in discovering such complicated truths, or for foreseeing consequences so remote from their first principle. It is hence evident, from this very impossibility, that Newton attained these great results by the help of analytical methods, of which he had himself so much increased the power; and this conclusion acquires certainty form the correspondence between Newton and Cotes, relating to the second edition[36] of the Principia, for in it we find Cotes, the pupil of Newton, employing the analytical form either in submitting to Newton the difficulties he met with, or in solving them himself. It remains to be explained why Newton preferred setting forth his discoveries by a different method, thus depriving himself of the increase of glory he would infallibly have obtained, by giving to the world the several analytical inventions with which he must have been acquainted in solving the questions he has treated. Among these we may mention the principle of the calculus of variations, which must have been necessary to him in determining the solid of the least resistance. It were difficult to say with certainty what decided him to make such a sacrifice, but if we may hazard a conjecture, it may not be impossible that, from the excessive apprehension which he laboured under of having his results attacked, he preferred the sythetical form, as being a severer method of demonstration, and as being likely to inspire more confidence in those who should read his work at a time when the methods of the infinitesimal analysis were still but little known; and when, from their novelty, they might appear less convincing to many of his readers. Whilst the Principia were preparing for the press, chance produced an incident that drew Newton from his studious retreat, and brought him on the theatre of public affairs. King James II. desiring to re-establish catholicism in England, and thinking fit to attack the usages and rights of the Protestants, had, among other measures, commanded[37] the University of Cambridge to confer the degree of M.A. on Francis, a Benedictine Monk, without requiring of him the oath prescribed by the statutes against the catholic religion. The University asserted its privileges; and Newton (who had shown himself one of the most ardent in encouraging resistance) was one of the delegates sent to maintain their rights before the High Commission Court. These delegates made so firm and unexpected a defence, that the king thought proper to drop the affair. It was this circumstance, perhaps, as much as the personal merit of Newton, that induced the University to elect him, the following year, as their representative to serve in the Convention Parliament, which declared the throne vacant, and called William to the crown. He sat in this parliament until its dissolution, but without acting a remarkable part. C. Montague, afterwards Earl of Halifax, was a member at the same time, and having been educated at Cambridge, was able to appreciate the merit of the genius who formed the glory of the University. Hence, when Halifax, having become Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1696, conceived the design of a general recoinage, he demanded and obtained for Newton the honourable and lucrative employment of Warden of the Mint, which was at once an act of kindness, and a choice influenced by discernment. In fact, Newton rendered very signal service in executing the important measure which the statesman had determined on; beingpeculiarly fitted for the business by his singular mathematical and chemical knowledge. It appears that he had always taken great interest in chemistry; for, from the time when, as a child, he had lived with the apothecary at Grantham, till he resided at Cambridge, he had continued to occupy himself occasionally with that science. Of this we have a proof in his philosophical works, which are filled with profound chemical observations. In tracing the order of these labours, we find him, in his first researches about telescopes, in 1672, making a number of experiments on the alloys of metals, in order to discover the combinations most advantageous for optical purposes, and amassing in these essays a number of remarkable peculiarities in the constitution of bodies. Three years afterwards, the paper on the colours in thin plates affords us still more varied experiments on the combinations of different bodies, solid or liquid, with each other, and on the tendency or the repugnancy they have to unite; still later, the same subjects are treated with greater boldness and comprehensiveness in the Treatise on Optics, and particularly in the queries placed at the end of that admirable work; for what, at that time, could be bolder, than to assert that water must contain an inflammable principle, and that a similar one exists in the diamond?
Besides the natural charm a mind like Newton's must have felt, in the various astonishing and mysterious phenomena of chemistry, what additional interest must they have excited in him, when, having discovered the existence of molecular attraction, and the effects of actions exerted at small distances in the motion of light, he was led to see that similar forces, differing only in their law of decrease, or intensity, would be sufficient to produce in the ultimate particles of bodies all those phenomena of union and disunion, that constitute the science of chemistry! With these new and important phenomena, he occupied himself constantly at Cambridge; and, along with the study of chronology and history, they were the only relaxation he allowed himself when fatigued with his mathematical meditations. He had constructed a small laboratory for prosecuting such pursuits; and it would seem that in the years immediately following the publication of the Principia, he devoted almost his whole time to them. But a disastrous accident deprived him, in an instant, of the fruits of so much labour, and lost them to science for ever. labours of so many years reduced to ashes. It is said, that on first perceiving this great loss, he contented himself by exclaiming, "Oh, Diamond! Diamond! thou little knowest the mischief thou hast done." But the grief caused by this circumstance, grief which reflection must have augmented, instead of alleviating, injured his health, and, if we may venture to say so, for some time impaired his understanding. This incident in Newton's life, which appears to be confirmed by many collateral circumstances, is mentioned in a manuscript note of Huygens, which was communicated to M. Biot, of the French Institute, by Mr. Vanswinden, in the following letter: —
"There is among the manuscripts of the celebrated Huygens, a small journal in folio, in which he used to note down different occurrences; it is side Z., No. 8, page 112, in the catalogue of the library at Leyden: the following extract is written by Huygens himself, with whose hand-writing I am well acquainted, having had occasion to peruse several of his manuscripts and autograph letters.[38] On the 29th May, 1694, a Scotchman of the name of Colin, informed me, that Isaac Newton, the celebrated mathematician, eighteenth months previously, had become deranged in his mind, either from too great application to his studies, or from excessive grief at having lost, by fire, his chemical laboratory and some papers. Having made observations before the Chancellor of Cambridge,which indicated the alienation of his intellect, he was taken care of by his friends, and being confined to his house, remedies were applied, by means of which he has lately so far recovered his health as to begin to again understand his own Principia. Huygens mentioned this circumstance to Leibnitz, in a letter, dated the 8th of the following June, to which the latter replied on the twenty-third. 'I am very happy that I received information of the cure of Mr. Newton, at the same time that I first heard of his illness, which, without doubt, must have been most alarming. It is to men like Newton and yourself, Sir, that I desire health and a long life."
This account by Huygens is corroborated by the following extract from a MS. at Cambridge, written by Mr. Abraham de la Pryne, dated Feb. 3. 1692, in which, after mentioning the circumstance of the papers being set fire to, he says, "But when Mr. Newton came from chapel, and had seen what was done, every one thought he would have run mad, he was so troubled thereat, that he was not himself for a month after." From these details, it would appear that the mind of this great man was affected, either by excess of exertion, or through grief at seeing the result of its efforts destroyed. In truth, there is nothing extraordinary in either of these suppositions; nor ought we to be astonished that the first sentiments arising from the great affliction which befell Newton were expressed without violence, for his mind was, as it were, prostrated under their weight. But the fact of a derangement in his intellect, whatever may have been the cause, will explain how, after the publication of the Principia, in 1687, Newton, though only forty-five years old, never more gave to the world a new work in any branch of science; and why he contented himself with merely publishing those that he had composed long before this epoch, confining himself to the completion of those parts that required development. We may also remark, that even these explanations appear in every case to be taken from experiments or observations previously made; as for instance, the additions to the second edition of the Principia in 1713, the experiments on thick plates, on diffraction, and the chemical queries placed at the end of the Optics, in 1704; for Newton distinctly announces them to be taken from manuscripts which he had formerly written; and adds, that though he felt the necessity of extending, or of rendering them more perfect, yet henceforth such subjects were no longer in his way.[39] Thus it appears, that though he had recovered his health sufficiently to understand all his researches, and even, in some cases, to make additions or useful alterations (as is shown by the second edition of the Principia, for which he kept up a very active mathematical correspondence with Cotes), yet he did not wish to undertake new labours in the department of science where he had done so much, and where he was so well able to conceive what remained to do. But whether this determination were imposed on him by necessity, or merely caused by a sort of moral weariness, the result of so long and severe an exercise of thought, what Newton had already done is sufficient to place him in the first rank of discoverers in every branch of pure and applied mathematics. After having admired him as almost the creator of Natural Philosophy, as one of the chief promoters of mathematical analysis, we must acknowledge, also, that to him we owe the first idea of mechanical chemistry; since he regarded its combinations as the result of molecular action, and by the boldest and most felicitous inductions raised himself to a conception of the composition and variation in the state of bodies, such as before his time was unknown and unthought of. Uniting so much theoretical and experimental knowledge, Newton must have been of the greatest service in superintending the melting down of the old coinage, which, from its worn and depreciated state, it was necessary to call in; and we find, accordingly, that in three years time (1699) he was recompensed for his services by the lucrative appointment of Master of the Mint. Hitherto, his means had been small[40] for his domestic wants. This new accession of fortune, however, did not render him unworthy of it; having gained it by merit, he maintained his title to it by the use he made of it. At this time, all the clouds had disappeared with which the spirit of jealousy had endeavoured to obscure his glory. He had raised himself too high to have a rival remaining, and due homage was paid from all quarters to his transcendent talents.
In 1699, the Académie des Sciences at Paris being empowered by a new Royal Charter to admit a very small number of foreign associates, hastened to make this distinction yet more honourable by enrolling on its lists the name of Newton. In 1701, the University of Cambridge again elected him to serve in Parliament.
In 1703, he was chosen President of the Royal Society of London, a title which renders the person on whom it is conferred, as it were, the public representative of philosophy and science, and gives to him an influence the more useful, because it proceeds from voluntary confidence. Newton was annually re-elected to this honourable office, and continued to fill it during the remainder of his life (a period of twenty-five years); and finally, in 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne. He now determined to publish himself, or to allow others to publish, his different works. He first gave to the world his Optics, a treatise which comprises all his researches on light. It would appear that, fatigued with the petty attacks that his ideas on these subjects had drawn upon him (in 1672-5), Newton had resolved not to publish this work during the life of Hooke; the latter, however, died in 1702, and the jealous influence he had been able to exercise had previously expired. Newton, having no longer any fear of controversy, did not delay publishing these discoveries, which, though of a different description, and of a less general application that those which the world had admired in the Principia, are not inferior to them in the originality of their conception.
When the Optics appeared, in 1704, it was written in English. Dr. Samuel Clarke, afterwards so celebrated for his controversies with Leibnitz, published a Latin version in 1706, with which Newton was so satisfied, that he presented the translator with 500l. as a testimony of his acknowledgement; many editions of the work itself, and of the translation, rapidly succeeded each other, both in England and on the continent. Although the number of editions shows how much this treatise has from that time been admired, yet its whole merit has not been fully appreciated till within these few years, when new discoveries, and particularly that of the polarization of light, have rendered perceptible all the importance of certain very delicate phenomena, whose general existence Newton had pointed out in the propagation of light, and which, under the names of "fits of easy transmission and reflection," he considered as essential attributes of that principle. These properties being so subtile, that they escape all observations which are not extremely exact, and being at the same time so singular that, in order to admit them, it is necessary to have the fullest conviction of the accuracy of the experiments which establish them, they were, for a long period, regarded merely as ingenious hypotheses; and it has even been thought in some degree necessary to apologize for Newton's having mentioned them. But, in the present day, it is generally acknowledged that these properties, with the laws assigned to them by Newton, are modifications really and incontestably inherent in light, though their existence must be differently conceived and applied, according to the hypothesis we adopt as to the nature of the luminous principle.
To the first edition of the Optics, Newton added two analytical treatises, the one entitled "Enumeratio linearum tertii ordinis," and the other, "Tractatus de quadratura curvarum." The latter contains an explanation of the method of fluxions, and its application to the quadrature of curves, by means of expansion into infinite series; and the first a very elegant classification of curves of the third order, with a clear and rapid enumeration of their properties, which Newton probably had discovered by the method of expansion, enunciated in the former treatise; though he merely indicates the results, without mentioning the process which he had employed in investigating them. These two treatises were withdrawn from the following editions of the Optics, with the subject of which they were not sufficiently connected; but we may presume that Newton's object in inserting them in the edition of 1704 was to insure his right to the discovery and application of those new analytical methods, which, after having been so long in his secret, and as he supposed, sole possession, had now for several years been making their way with much success on the continent, and were there producing new and important results in the hands of foreign analysts, particularly of Leibnitz, and the Bernoullis.<28>
The great renown which Newton had acquired, caused all his productions to be received with avidity. Hence it was that Whiston published in 1707, without the knowledge or consent of Newton, the "Arithmetica universalis," which appears to have been merely the text of the lectures on Algebra, that he delivered at Cambridge, written rapidly for his own use, and not intended for publication. Science, however, must congratulate itself on the transgression of confidence that has fortunately made this work known; for it were impossible to see a more perfect model of the art by which geometrical or numerical questions may be submitted to algebraical calculation; whether we regard the happy choice of the unknown quantities, or the ingenious combination of analytical formulæ, employed in finding the simplest method of solution. A second and more complete edition was published in London in 1712, according to Gravesande, with the participation of Newton himself — a proof that this production of his youth appeared to him neither unworthy of his name nor of his attention.
It was also, by the care of some other editor, but with his consent, that in 1711 a small treatise, entitled "Methodus differentialis," was published, in which he shows how to draw a parabolic curve through any given number of points — a determination which, when reduced to formulæ, is very useful in the interpolation of series, and in approximating to the quadratures of curves.
In the same year, by other hands, was published the long-suppressed treatise, "Analysis per equationes numero terminorum infinitas," which he had composed in 1665, and in which, as we have already said, he had explained is first discoveries in fluxions, and in expansions, by means of infinite series. A copy of this dissertation had formerly been taken by Collins, from the original sent to him by Barrow; and having been found among his papers after his death, leave was obtained from Newton to publish it — a permission which he probably have the more willingly, as the work being of old date, incontestably established his claims to the invention of the new method.
Newton formerly had prepared, on the same subject, a more extensive treatise, entitled, "A method of Fluxions," which he proposed to join as an introduction to a treatise on algebra, by Kinckhuysen, of which he had undertaken to publish an edition in 1672: this, without doubt, would have been more valuable than the book itself, but his fear of scientific quarrels induced him them to keep his manuscript secret. Towards the close of his life, he again thought of publishing it, but it was not printed till after his death. The same apprehension had, as we have already said, prevented him from publishing his "Optical Lectures" delivered at Cambridge. Happily, however, he had entrusted copies to many persons, and among others, to Gregory, professor of astronomy at Oxford, one of which being printed three years after his death, has preserved to us this work. It presents a very detailed experimental exposition of the phenomena of the composition and decomposition of light, with their most usual applications: it is, in fact, the Optics without the most difficult part, viz. the theory of colours produced by thin plates; but, in the other parts, fully developed both by calculations and by numerous experiments. In this form, it was extremely proper for the use to which Newton intended it, and at this day it offers a most valuable model for an elementary exposition of phenomena by experiment.
Here would terminate our account of the works on which the fame of Newton reposes, had not a new literary dispute (about 1712), which, in fact, he did not provoke, and the existence of which, perhaps, he more than once regretted, completely revealed all the fertility of his wonderful genius, and assembled a multitude of analytical discoveries, which we find in the correspondence that ensued. We have seen that Newton, for a long time, obstinately guarded the secret of his discoveries, and particularly that of the method of fluxions, of which he justly foresaw the future utility in calculating the phenomena of nature. However, in 1676, Leibnitz having heard of the new results that Newton was said to have obtained by means of infinite series, testified to Oldenburg the desire he felt to become acquainted with them. The latter induced Newton not to refuse a communication which could not but be honourable to him. In consequence (23rd of June, 1676), Newton sent to Oldenburg a letter to be transmitted to Leibnitz, in which he gave expressions for the expansion in series of binomial powers, of the sine in terms of the arc, of the arc gaged or not of radical quantities; "but," he adds, "as I cannot push further the explication of this method, I have concealed the principle in this anagram."[41]in terms of its sine, and of elliptical, circular, and hyperbolic functions, without, however, any demonstration or indication of the means he had used for obtaining these results; merely stating that he possessed a method by which, when these series were given, he could obtain the quadratures of the curves from which they were derived, as well as the surfaces and centres of gravity of the solids formed by their rotation. This may in fact be done by considering each term of these series as the ordinate of a particular curve, and by then applying the method previously given by Mercator, for squaring curves, of which the ordinates are expressed rationally in terms of the abscissa. This is precisely what Leibnitz remarked in his answer to Newton on the 27th of the following August, adding that he should be glad to know the demonstration of the theorems on which Newton founded his method of reducing into series; but that, for himself, though he recognized the utility of this method, he employed another, which consisted in decomposing the given curve into its superficial elements, and in transforming these infinitely small elements into others, equivalent to them, but belonging to a curve whose ordinate was expressed rationally in terms of the abscissa, so that the method of Mercator might be applied in squaring it. After giving different explanations of this method, he declares in express terms that he does not believe that "all problems, except those of Diophantes, can be resolved by it alone, or by series," as Newton had affirmed in his letter; and among the problems which elude these processes, he mentions the case of finding curves from their tangents; adding that he had already treated many questions of this sort by means of a direct analysis, and that the most difficult had been thus solved. This was more than enough to show Newton that Leibnitz was at least upon the track of the infinitesimal calculus, if he did not possess it already; and, therefore, in his answer (dated Oct. 24th, though apparently delivered to Leibnitz much later), after giving the explanations requested by Leibnitz on the formation of binomial series, and after stating to him the succession of ideas, by means of which he had discovered them, Newton hastens to declare that he possesses for drawing tangents to curves a method equally applicable to equations, whether disen
He announced that he had established on this foundation many theorems for simplifying the quadrature of curves, and gave expressions for the areas in terms of the ordinates in several simple cases; but he enveloped both the method and the principle on which it rested in another anagram more complicated than the first.
The evident object of Newton, in this letter, was to place his claims to priority of invention in the hands of Leibnitz himself. The noble frankness of Leibnitz appears to the greatest advantage: for in his answer to Newton (21st of June, 1677) he employs neither anagram nor evasion, but details simply and openly the method of the infinitesimal calculus, with the differential notation, the rules of differentiation, the formation of differential equations, and the applications of these processes to various questions in analysis and geometry; and, what mathematicians will consider as far from being unimportant, the figures employed in the exposition of these methods offer precisely the same letters, and the same method of notation, that Leibnitz had used in his first letter of the 14th of April the preceding year. Newton made no reply to this memorable letter, either because he no longer felt the wish, or because, from Oldenburg's death, (which happened in the autumn of the same year,) he had no longer an opportunity of doing so.
Leibnitz published his differential method in the Leipzig Acts for 1684, in a form exactly similar to that which he had sent Newton. No claim was set up at that time to contest his right of discovery, and Newton himself, three years afterwards, eternalized that right by recognizing it in the Principia, in the following terms.[42] "In a correspondence which took place about ten years ago, between that very celebrated mathematician G. Leibnitz and myself, I mentioned to him that I possessed a method (which I concealed in an anagram) for determining maxima andminima, for drawing tangents, and for similar operations, which was equally applicable both to rational and irrational quantities: that illustrious man replied that he also had fallen on a method of the same kind (se quoque in ejusmodi methodum incidisse), and communicated to me his method, which scarcely differed from mine, except in the notation and the idea of the generation of quantities."
There is a curious ambiguity in the words, "he replied that he had fallen on a method of the same kind," which, to those who had not seen the letters that were interchanged, might convey the idea, that Leibnitz had discovered the key to Newton's anagram; but this meaning is not to be found in Leibnitz's letter; he only announces a supposition, honourable to his character, viz. that the concealed method of Newton has, perhaps, some connexion with that which he communicates to him. With this explanation, the above passage in the Principia is in truth a formal recognition of Leibnitz's claims. It was so considered by every one when it appeared, and during twenty years Leibnitz was allowed, without any dispute, to develop all the parts of the differential calculus, and to deduce from it an immense number of brilliant applications, which seemed to extend the power of mathematical analysis far beyond any preconceived limits. In this interval, Wallis, by publishing the above-mentioned letters between Leibnitz and Newton, only rendered, if possible, the claims of the former more complete and more incontestable in the eyes of every impartial person. It was not till 1699 that Nicholas Fatio de Duillier,[43] in a Memoir, in which he employed the infinitesimal calculus, claimed, in favour of Newton, the first invention of it; "and," added he, "with regard to what Mr. Leibnitz, the second inventor of this calculus may have borrowed from Newton, I refer to the judgement of those persons who have seen the letters and manuscripts relating to this business." Did Fatio really believe what he was writing, or did he wish to flatter the national pride of the country in which he lived? or was he not in some manner irritated at Leibnitz having rendered so little justice to the Principia, and at his appearing to arrogate to himself a sort of empire over all discoveries made by the aid of the new calculus? These questions we do not pretend to decide; but the two latter suppositions are the most probable. Leibnitz replied, by stating the fact, and quoting his letters, and the testimony rendered to him by Newton himself. Fatio was silent; and thus the matter stood till 1704, when Newton published the Optics. In giving an account of the treatise on the quadrature of curves, which was joined to this work, the editor of the Leipzig Acts naturally mentioned the evident analogy that existed between Newton's method of fluxions and the differential calculus which had been published twenty years previously by Leibnitz, in the same Acts, and which had since become the means of making an infinity of analytical discoveries. In comparing the two methods, the editor (whom Newton supposes to have been Leibnitz himself) did not precisely say, that the method of fluxions was a mere transformation of the differential calculus; but he used terms which might bear such an interpretation. This was the signal for attack, on the part of the English writers; one of the most violent of them, Keil, professor of astronomy at Oxford, said, in a paper printed in the Philosophical Transactions, not only that Newton was the first inventor of the method of fluxions, but also that Leibnitz had stolen it from him, by merely changing the name and the notation used by Newton. This produced an indignant reply from Leibnitz, who had the imprudence to submit the question to the judgement of the Royal Society, that is to say, of a tribunal which was presided over by his rival. The society, with scrupulous fidelity, collected all the original letters that could be found bearing on the matter in question, and thus, with regard to the facts, its conduct was unimpeachable; but the most important and delicate part of the business, viz. the discussion of those papers, and the consequences to be deduced by them, it referred to arbitrators chose by itself, who were not known, and about whose appointment Leibnitz was not consulted. These arbitrators decided that Newton had indubitably been the first discoverer of the method of fluxions, a truth which is certainly incontestable in the sense that discovery and invention are synonymous terms; but they also added two assertions, which can only be considered as the expression of their personal opinion — first, that the differential and gents, an assertion which he was far from admitting. Newton suffered himself to be carried away so far as to pretend that the paragraph inserted in the Principia, by which he had so openly acknowledged the independent rights of Leibnitz, was by no means intended to render him that testimony, but, on the contrary, to establish the priority of the method of fluxions over that of the differential calculus. Newton's animosity was not even calmed by the death of Leibnitz, in 1716: for he immediately afterwards printed two manuscript letters of Leibnitz, written in the preceding year, accompanied with a bitter refutation. Six years later, (in 1722) he caused a new edition of the Commercium Epistolicum to be printed, at the head of which he placed a very partial extract from this Collection. This was apparently made by himself, and had already appeared two years before the death of Leibnitz, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1715. Finally, Newton had the weakness to leave out, or allow to be left out, in the third edition of the Principia, published under his own inspection, 1725, the famous Scholium, in which he had admitted the rights of his rival. To render such conduct, not to say excusable, but even comprehensible, on the part of a man who must so well have known that the only tribunal that can decide on such causes is impartial posterity, it is necessary to say that Leibnitz, on his side, had neither been less passionate nor less unjust. Hurt by the unexpected publication of the Commercium Epistolicum, and irritated by a decision, give without his knowledge, by judges whom he had not appointed, and who had not waited for his defence, he summoned contrary testimonies in his support. Leibnitz had the misfortune to produce proofs equally exaggerated with those brought forward by Newton. He printed, and spread throughout Europe, an anonymous letter (since discovered to have been written by J. Bernoulli), extremely injurious to Newton, whom it represented as having fabricated his method of fluxions from the differential calculus. Leibnitz committed a still greater fault. He was in the habit of corresponding with the Princess of Wales, daughter-in-law to George the First. This princess, endowed with a highly cultivated mind, had received Newton with extreme kindness, and was fond of conversing with him. She declared that she esteemed herself happy in living at a time that enabled her to become acquainted with so great a genius. Leibnitz made use of his correspondence with the princess, to lower Newton in her eyes, and to represent his philosophy to her not only as physically false, but also as dangerous in a religious point of view; and, what is still more inconceivable, he founded these accusations on passages in the Principia, and in the Optics, which Newton had evidently composed and inserted with intentions sincerely religious, and as a genuine professions of his firm belief in a divine Providence. For instance, in explaining the true method to be pursued in natural philosophy, Newton says, in his Twenty-eighth Query,  which things, the images only, carried through the organs of sense into our little sensoriums, are there seen and beheld, by that which in us perceives and thinks; and though every true step made in this philosophy bring us not immediately to the knowledge of the First Cause, yet it brings us nearer to it, and on that account is to be highly valued?"fluxional methods are one and the same thing; and, secondly, that Leibnitz must have seen a letter of Newton's, (dated 10th December, 1672,) in which the method of fluxions is described in a manner sufficiently clear for any intelligent person to understand. Now of these two assertions, the second is not proved in any one of its parts, and the letter of Newton alluded to, appears, according to his custom, to have been more intended for establishing his right, than proper for indicating the manner of attaining his method. With regard to the first assertion, that the methods are absolutely identical, it may easily be refuted by the simple consideration, that if the method of fluxions alone existed at the present moment, the invention of the differential calculus with its notation, and its principle of decomposition into infinitely small elements, would still be an admirable discovery, and one which would immediately bring to light a number of applications, which we now possess, but which probably would not have been obtainable without its assistance. Admitting, then, as certain, the priority of Newton's ideas on this subject, we think that the reserve he maintained regarding it left the field open to all other inventors; and that from the general tendency of the mathematical researches of that period, both Leibnitz and Newton might have separately arrived by different means at the knowledge of a method, the want of which was then so sensibly felt in all analytical researches. The quarrel between Newton and Leibnitz has not been without advantage to mathematical science; since it produced the previous collection of letters on infinitesimal analysis, collected by the Royal Society, and published in 1712, under the name of the Commercium Epistolicum. But as regards these two great men themselves, the bitterness with which it inspired the one against the other, became the torment and the misfortune of the remainder of their lives. Newton went so far as to affirm, that Leibnitz had deprived him of the differential calculus, and then that this calculus was identical with Barrow's method of tangents: an assertion of which he could not but have perceived the injustice, since, if he pretended, on the one hand, that the differential calculus and the method of fluxions were the same, he must have also admitted the method of fluxions to be identical with Barrow's method of tan
It is thus that Newton speaks of a Supreme Being; and even those who might dispute the arguments which he gives for such an existence, must still recognize, in this passage, the sentiments of a mind deeply imbued with religious feelings, and convinced of their true foundation. It was upon this ground, however, that Leibnitz attacked him in his correspondence with the princess: "it appears," says he, in one of his letters, "that natural religion is diminishing extremely in England;" and he cites as a proof the works of Locke, and the above passage from Newton; elsewhere he says, "that these principles are precisely those of the materialists." When we see a mind of the order of that of Leibnitz expressing itself with such blind contempt for the grand and incontrovertible discovery of universal gravitation, and employing such arguments in objecting to it, we are disposed to compassionate the occasional weakness of the finest intellects, and to deplore the petty passions which tarnish the splendour of genius. The rank of the person to whom this accusation was addressed increased its importance in those days. The king was informed of the matter, and expressed his expectation that Newton would reply. It would appear that it was this authority that determined Newton personally to enter the lists; but he only undertook the defence of the mathematical part of the question; the philosophical part he left to Dr. Clarke, who, though inferior as a mathematician, was a better metaphysician than himself. From this resulted a great number of letters, written by Clarke and Leibnitz to each other, which were all inspected by the princess. In the course of all this correspondence, as often happens, the original question was lost amidst collateral disquisitions.[44] On reading these letters, it must excite surprise that a woman of rank could amuse herself with discussions of this sort,mixed up as they were with the coarse and erudite jests made use of by Leibnitz. To this taste, however, of the princess for serious matters we owe our acquaintance with a work of Newton, very different from those that we have hitherto mentioned. Conversing one day on some historical subject, Newton explained to her a system of chronology, which he had formerly composed, simply for amusement. The princess was so much pleased with it, that she requested a copy, for her own use, on which latter condition Newton complied with her request: he, however, gave also a copy to the Abbé Conti, who had made himself remarkable by interfering in the disputes between Leibnitz and Newton. No sooner was the Abbé in Paris, than he communicated this manuscript to the world. It was immediately translated and printed, not only without the consent or knowledge of Newton, but even accompanied with a refutation by Fréret. Newton had thus the mortification to hear at the same time of the publication and the reply, without having had any suspicion of the transaction; and was hence obliged, though contrary to his original intention, at least to give a more correct edition; but he was only able to prepare one: it did not appear till after his death in 1728.
This leads us to speak of another work of Newton, which, though appearing to differ much in its title from the one we have just mentioned, is, like it, an historical memoir; the title is, "Observations upon the Prophecies of Holy Writ, particularly the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John." Notwithstanding the singularity such a subject appears to offer, when treated of by a mind like that of Newton, we venture to affirm, that more persons have spoken of this dissertation than have given themselves the trouble to read it; it therefore becomes our duty here to point out more particularly the object which Newton had in view, and his manner of proceeding. The groundwork of his reasoning is concisely expressed by the following words in the work itself:[45] —
"The folly of interpreters hath been to for. Now," says Newton, "for understanding the prophecies, we are in the first place to acquaint ourselves with the figurative language of the prophets; this language is taken from the analogy between the world natural and an empire or kingdom considered as a world politic."[46] He then successively enters into all the details of this connexion; first of all considering the heavens and the earth as representing thrones and people; then taking the astronomical phenomena, the rain, the hail, the meteors, the animals, the vegetables, their different parts, their different actions, and those of man himself; and finally, every thing in the material world, as having a peculiar mystic signification which he fixes and defines: "for instance," says; seeing for understanding and policy; and in matters of religion the επισχοποι, bishops; speaking for making laws; the mouth for a lawgiver, &c. &c."[47] Down to this point we find, in fact, nothing new, except the precise and, in some degree, systematic explanation of the method of interpretation: for at bottom this method is that which has been employed by all commentators; and it is really impossible to employ any other, in applying a prophecy which is not explicit in its terms. The distinguishing character of Newton's work is, that having thus made his glossary beforehand, it often suffices him for explaining a prophecy, to place the figurative terms word for word opposite to the explanations: by these means he makes a quicker and more extended progress. We will not follow him in the vast career he proposed to go over. Furnished with what he considered a key to prophetical language, he successively questions Daniel and St. John, and endeavours to produce, from their prophecies, the historical events that have taken place since their time. His work is immense; it embraces not only the principal epochs, and the most important events, in the ancient and in a part of the middle ages, but also a multitude of particular facts, of chronological observations, and of researches on civil or ecclesiastical antiquities, showing deep and extensive knowledge, taken from the most authentic sources. To give an idea of the detailed applications by which Newton has allowed himself to be carried away in this singular composition, and at the same time not to leave unnoticed the spirit of prejudice of which unhappily it bears the stamp, we will extract a passage in the seventh and eighth chapters of the first part. Newton has explained the ten horns of the fourth beast of Daniel by the ten kingdoms which the barbarians founded on the ruins of the Roman empire in the west, and has rapidly traced the history of each of these kingdoms, in order to show how it agrees with the prophecies. It remains to explain the eleventh horn of the same beast: the words of scripture are:  one who stood by, and made Daniel know the interpretation of these things, told him, that the ten horns were ten kings that should arise, and another should arise after them and be diverse from the first, and he should subdue three kings, and speak great words against the Most High, and wear out the saints, and think to change times and laws: and that they should be given into his hands until a time and times and half a time." "Now," says Newton, ." Newton then supports this analogy by an historical account of the rise and progress of the papal power, the details of which he, in succession, compares with the prophecy. Newton carries this investigation no further than the last half of the eighth century, because," says he, "the Pope, by acquiring temporal power, is clearly designated by the prophet:" but carried beyond the limits previously assigned by himself to interpreters, he goes on to predict the epoch of the fall, or at least decline of this temporal power, for translating the expression of Daniel, "a time and times and half a time," by 1260 solar years, and indicating the year 800 as about the point to count from, he fixes the fatal term to be about the year 2060. We must remark, that this conclusion is not, in his work, as in those of some other protestant writers, dictated by any sectarian or party feeling; he states it with all the calm of entire conviction, and with all the simplicity of an evident demonstration. It appears to be not Newton, but St. John and Daniel, who attack the power of modern Rome, who characterize it by injurious terms, and finally predict its ruin.
It will, doubtless, be asked, how a mind of the character and force of Newton's, so habituated to the severity of mathematical considerations, so accustomed to the observation of real phenomena, so methodical, and so cautious, even at his boldest moments in physical speculation, and consequently so well aware of the conditions by which alone truth is to be discovered, could put together such a number of conjectures, without noticing the extreme improbability that is involved in all of them, from the infinite number of arbitrary postulates on which he endeavours to establish his system. The answer to this question must be taken entirely from the ideas and the habits of the age taneous decrease in temperature to be proportional to the temperature itself, and by observing the time of the arrival of the fluid at each degree of temperature intended to be marked. These two methods of observation are connected by applying them to the same temperature — for instance, to the fusion of tin, which is the highest in the one series, and the lowest in the other.in which Newton lived. Not only was Newton profoundly religious, but his whole life was spent, and all his affections were concentrated in a circle of men, who, holding the same doctrines, considered themselves bound by their station or profession to defend and propagate them. The English philosophers of that period took pleasure in combining the researches of science with theological discussion; to which they were the more inclined, because the cause of protestantism had identified itself with political liberty; and men studied the bible to find weapons against despotism. The choice of Newton by the University of Cambridge as one of the delegates sent to King James, shows clearly that he shared in such sentiments; nor is it a more surprising fact, that Newton wrote upon the Apocalypse, than that R. Boyle, one of the greatest natural philosophers of the same period, published a treatise, entitled "The Christian Virtuoso," of which the object is to show that experimental philosophy conduces to a man being a good Christian, — than that Wallis, the celebrated mathematician, composed a number of tracts on religious subjects, — than that Barrow who reckoned Newton himself among his pupils, and who resigned in his favour the mathematical chair, consecrated his latter years to theology, in order to take the degree of doctor in the faculty — that Hooke, whom we have so often mentioned, composed a work on the Tower of Babel — that Whiston, Newton's pupil and successor at Cambridge, also composed an essay "on the Revelation of St. John," and other treatises on pure theology — that Clarke, another still more illustrious pupil of Newton, the faithful translator of his Optics, the zealous promoter and ingenious defender of his philosophy, was at the same time the most profound theologian and sublime preacher in England; and finally, that Leibnitz himself, to take no other example, in the course of his literary life, voluntarily made numerous excursions into the provinces of natural theology, revelation, and biblical criticism; that he commented on the story of Balaam, treated in various ways the question of grace, and with the laudable intention of uniting Protestants and Catholics, discussed with Bossuet the principal doctrinal points which separate the two churches. This alliance of the exact sciences with religious controversy, at that time so general, is the natural mode of accounting for the theological researches of Newton, however singular they might appear at the present day. There is another tract belonging to the same class of writings, which we must also mention, not only from the importance of the subject in a religious point of view, but also because it affords us a new opportunity of seeing the extensive knowledge which Newton possessed in these matters. The title is "An historical account of two notable corruptions in the Scriptures," in fifty pages 4to.; it contains a critical discussion of two passages in the Epistles of St. John and St. Paul, relating to the doctrine of the Trinity, which Newton supposes to have been altered by the copyists. From the nature of the subject, and from certain indications at the beginning of the pamphlet, it probably was composed when the works of Whiston and of Clarke on the same subject drew upon them the attacks of all the English theologians, that is, about 1712-13. It is certainly very remarkable that a man of the age of seventy-two or seventy-five should be able to compose rapidly, as he himself insinuates, so extensive a piece of sacred criticism, and of literary history, in which the logically connected arguments are always supported by the most varied erudition. At this period of Newton's life, the reading of religious works had become one of his most habitual occupations; and after he had performed the duties of his office, they formed, along with the conversation of his friends, his only amusement. He had now almost ceased to think of science, and as we have already remarked, since the fatal aberration of his intellect in 1693, he gave to the world only three really new scientific productions. One of these had probably been prepared some time previously, and the other must have occupied but little time: the first, published in the Philosophical Transactions, consists of only five, though very important, pages. It contains a comparative scale of temperatures, from the point of melting ice to that of the ignition of charcoal; the lower degrees are observed by means of a thermometer of linseed oil, the scale of which is divided into equal parts; the zero corresponds to the melting point of ice, and the 81st degree to the melting point of tin. The higher degrees are calculated according to the law of cooling in a metallic mass, by supposing the instan
We have thus in this paper three important discoveries — first, a method of comparing thermometers, by determining the extreme terms of their scale from phenomena taking place at constant temperatures — secondly, the determination of the laws of cooling in solid bodies at slightly elevated temperatures; and thirdly, the observation of the constancy of temperature in the phenomena of melting and boiling — a constancy which has since become one of the foundations of the modern theory of heat: this important fact is established in Newton's treatise, by numerous and various experiments, made not only on compound bodies, and the simple metals, but on various metallic alloys, which shows us that Newton clearly perceived their importance. There is reason to believe that this paper was one of those composed before the fire in his laboratory.
The second paper we must mention, also dated 1700, was communicated by Newton to Halley, and was a plan for an instrument for reflection to observe with at sea, without the observer being disturbed by the motion of the ship. It has been pretended that this idea, since so generally and so usefully employed by navigators, had been invented a long time previously by Hooke. It is true that in the history of the Royal Society for 1666, there is mentioned an instrument proposed by Hooke, to measure angles by means of the reflection of light; this announcement, however, is unaccompanied by any description to enable us to judge of the nature of the instrument; and if we endeavour to supply this defect by consulting the works of Hooke, written after this period, we shall find, that though he often makes use of reflection, it is always when applied to large fixed instruments; an idea which has no relation to that of employing reflection in moveable instruments, in order to render the angular distance of remote objects under observation independent of small changes of place in the centre of obser
vation from which they are viewed. There is no reason to believe that any one formed this happy and important idea before Newton, though the inexplicable silence of Halley, with regard to Newton's letter to him, left to another man, Hadley, the honour of again conceiving it (in 1731), and of so happily executing it, that mariners have given the name of Hadley's Quadrant to this ingenious and useful invention.
The last labour of Newton that remains to be mentioned, was of another sort, and composed on a totally different occasion. In 1696, J. Bernoulli proposed to the mathematicians of Europe, to discover a curve, down which a heavy body should descend in the quickest time possible, between two given points at unequal heights. Newton having received this problem, presented on the next day a solution of it, but without any demonstration, merely saying that the required curve must be a cycloid, for the determination of which he gave a method. This solution appeared anonymously in the Philosophical Transactions, but J. Bernoulli immediately guessed the author; "tanquam," says he, "ex ungue Leonem." This method of defiance, then in vogue, was again presented some years later to Newton, but by a more formidable adversary, and in a case where victory was of still more importance. In 1716, when the dispute about the invention of the infinitesimal analysis was at his height, Leibnitz wishing to show the superiority of his calculus over Newton's method of fluxions, sent, in a letter to the Abbé Conti, the enunciation of a certain problem, in which it was required to discover a curve such as should cut at right angles an infinity of curves of a given nature, but all expressible by the same equation; "he wished," he said, "to feel the pulse of the English analysts." Of course the question was a very difficult one. It is said that Newton received the problem at four in the afternoon as he was returning from the Mint, and, that though extremely fatigued with business, yet he finished the solution before retiring to rest. It has been, however, justly remarked, that Newton only gave the differential equation for the problem, and not its integral, in which the real difficulty consists. This was his last effort of the kind; and he soon entirely ceased to occupy himself with mathematics: so that during the last ten years of his life, when consultedabout any passage in his works, his reply was, "Address yourself to Mr. De Moivre, he knows that better than I do." And then, when his surrounding friends testified to him the just admiration his discoveries had universally excited, he said, "I know not what the world will think of my labours, but, to myself, it seems that I have been but as a child playing on the sea-shore; now finding some pebble rather more polished, and now some shell rather more agreeably variegated than another, while the immense ocean of truth extended itself unexplored before me."[48]
This profound conviction of the numerous discoveries that still remained to be made, did not, however, bring him again on that sea where he had advanced so much farther than any other man. His mind, fatigued by long and painful efforts, had need of complete and entire repose. At least we know, that thenceforward he only occupied his leisure with religious studies, or sought relief in literature or in business. Newton, the greatest of mankind in science, was, if we may dare say so, but an ordinary man in other pursuits; he never distinguished himself in parliament, to which he was twice summoned; and in one instance he appears to have acted with inexplicable timidity.[49] In 1713, a bill was brought in for encouraging the discovery of a method for finding the longitude at sea. Whiston, the author of the bill, and who himself tried to gain the reward proposed in it, obtained the appointment of a committee for discussing the measure; and four members of the Royal Society were invited to attend — Newton, Halley, Cotes, and Dr. Clarke: the three latter gave their opinions verbally, but Newton read his from a paper he had brought with him, without being understood by any one; he then sat down and obstinately kept silence, though much pressed to explain himself more distinctly. At last Whiston, seeing the bill was going to fail, took on himself to say, that Mr. Newton did not wish to explain more through fear of compromising himself, but that he really approved the measure. Newton then repeated word for word what Whiston had said, and the report was brought up. This almost puerile conduct, on such an occasion, tends to confirm the fact of the aberration of Newton's intellect in 1695, though it might have been merely the effect of excessive shyness, produced by the retired and meditative habits of his life. For, to judge from a letter of Newton,[50] written some time before the disastrous epoch, in which he points out the conduct to be pursued by a young traveller, it would appear that he was very ignorant of the habits of society.
From the manner in which his life was spent, we may easily conceive that he was never married, and (as Fontenelle says) that he never had leisure to think about it; that being immersed in profound and continual studies during the prime of his life, and afterwards engaged in an employment of great importance, and ever quite taken up with the company which his merit drew to him, he was not sensible of any vacancy in life, nor of the want of domestic society. His niece, who with her husband lived in his house, supplied the place of children, and attended to him with filial care. From the emoluments of his office — from a wise management of his patrimony – and from his simple manner of living, Newton became very rich, and employed his wealth in doing much good. He thought, says Fontenelle, that a legacy is no gift, and therefore left no will — it was always out of his present fortune that he proved his generosity to his relations, or to the friends whom he knew to be in want. His physiognomy might be called calm rather than expressive, and his manner languid rather than animated: his health remained good and uniform till his eightieth year; he never used spectacles. About that age he began to suffer from an incontinence of urine; but notwithstanding this infirmity, he still had, during his five remaining years, long intervals of health, or at least of freedom from pain, obtained by a strict regimen and other precautions, which till then he had never had occasion for. He was now obliged to rely upon Mr. Conduit, who had married his niece, for the discharge of his official duties at the Mint. Newton was useful to Conduit, even after death: for the honourable confidence that existed between them gave him a sort of claim to the office, which the king eagerly confirmed.<38>
"Newton," says Fontenelle, "did not suffer much, except in the last twenty days of his life: it was truly judged from the symptoms, that he was afflicted with the stone, and that he could not recover. In the paroxysms of pain, he uttered not a moan, nor gave any sign of impatience; and, as soon as he had a moment of relief, he smiled and spoke with his usual gaiety. Hitherto he had always employed some hours every day in either reading or writing. On Saturday the 18th of March, he read the papers in the morning, and conversed for some time with Dr. Mead, the physician who attended him, having then the perfect use of all his senses and his understanding; but in the evening, he entirely lost them without again recovering, as if the faculties of his mind were not destined to linger by degrees, but at once to vanish. He died the Monday following (March 20th, 1727,) at the age of eighty-five. His corpse lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, and was thence conveyed to Westminster Abbey; the funeral ceremony was numerously attended; the pall was supported by six peers; and every honour was paid to his remains."
The family of Newton, justly sensible of the distinction derived from their connexion with so great a genius, erected at a considerable expense a monument to his memory, on which is inscribed an epitaph, ending as follows: — "Sibi gratulentur mortales tale tantumque exstitisse humani generis decus." — "Let mortals congratulate themselves that so great an ornament of the human race has existed" — an eulogy which, though true in speaking of Newton, can be applied to no one else.
Besides the works we have already mentioned, Newton published an edition of the "Geographia Generalis" of Varenius, 8vo, 1672, reprinted in 1681. There is no really complete edition of the works of Newton, though Bishop Horsley published one in five volumes, 4to, to which he has given this title; but he has omitted a number of papers collected by Castillon (4 vols. 4to, Lausanne, 1744). By joining to these two books Newton's scientific letters inserted in the Biographia Britannica, we may make a tolerably complete collection of his works. Among the numerous translations that have appeared of the principal ones, we must not omit that of the Principia in French by Madame Duchâtelet, since it contains excellent notes supposed to be by Clairault. There are also two books in English, viz. H. Pemberton's "View of Sir I. Newton's Philosophy," (London, 1728, 4to), and C. Maclaurin's "Account of Sir I. Newton's Philosophical Discoveries," both of which will well repay the trouble of perusing them. It is, however, in the writings of the modern continental mathematicians, that we find the more complete development of those brilliant discoveries which have shed so much lustre on the name of Newton. It is with the works of LAPLACE, Lagrange, Biôt, Lacroix, Monge, Garnier, Poisson, DELAMBRE, Boucharbat, Carnot, Bailly, Bernouilli, Euler, Bossut, Montucla, De Zach, Lalande, Franœur, Legendre, Poisson, Gauss, Hauy, &c. &c., that the student must become acquainted, before he can hope to attain to a thorough knowledge of the system of the universe. In science, it is perhaps more necessary than in any other species of knowledge intimately to understand what has been done by our predecessors; and it therefore becomes our duty to express our earnest hope, that our readers will not merely content themselves with studying the works of that great man whose discoveries we have in this treatise recorded, but that, endeavouring themselves to enter on the same illustrious career, they will diligently peruse the writings of the distinguished individuals whose names we have just mentioned. A list is given in Hutton's Mathematical Dictionary of the principal MSS. now in existence, that were written by Newton.

These details of the infancy of Newton are taken chiefly from "Collections for the History of the Town and Soke of Grantham, containing authentic Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton, &c. by Edmund Turner, (London, 1806.)" And from the Eloge on Newton, written by Fontenelle.

Particularly in his Optics, where he attributes the discovery of the true theory of the rainbow to Antonius de Dominis, Archbishop of Spalatro, leaving to Descartes only the merit of having "mended the explication of the exterior bow;" and yet ever impartial reader, who refers to the original works, will see that the theory of Descartes is exact and complete, either as to the cause of the bow, its formation, or its size, and that he was only unacquainted with the cause of the different colours; and even, notwithstanding his ignorance relative to this part of the phenomenon, Descartes, with great sagacity, refers it to another experimental fact, by assimilating it to the colours formed by prisms. It is this formation of colours that Newton has so completely explained by the unequal refrangibility of the rays of light; but all the rest of the explanation is due to Descartes. The book of Dominis contains absolutely nothing but explications entirely vague, without any calculations or real result.

Newton afterwards shewed the truth of this result, by deducing it from a law observed by Kepler, in the movement of all the planets, which consists in the description of areas proportional to the times, by the radius vector drawn from each planet to the sun; but he did not know how to make use of this law till he had discovered the means of calculating the motion in an elliptic orbit; that is, about the end of the year 1679.

The following anecdote is told on this subject. Dr. Stukely, an intimate friend of Newton, called upon him one day when his dinner was already served up, but before he had appeared in the dining-room. Dr. Stukely having waited some time, and becoming impatient, at length removed the cover from a chicken, which he presently ate, putting the bones back into the dish and replacing the cover. After a short interval, Newton came into the room, and after the usual compliments, sat down to dinner, but on taking up the cover, and seeing only the bones of the bird left, he observed with some little surprise, "I thought I had not dined, but I now find that I have."

First day of the 50k novel challenge. I'm excited and frightened all at once.
You see, I'm my own worst critic. I will nitpick every flaw and eventually convince myself that what I've done is simply not good enough. This whole novel writing in one month thing is going to challenge me to the core.
I suppose to write without editing. Not going back and changing things, or analyzing what you wrote. Just write, that's the command. Just write.
An outline would be helpful, except I have no clue what I want to write about. Do I base it on my life and then turn it into fiction? Do I just go off the deep end and write about something all its own?
I really don't know. So tonight, after everyone is tucked in bed, I will sit down and start. I will pick my main character and start from there. I'm not expecting to write the next bestseller, or even a novel worthy of publishing.
But everyone, each one of my favorite writers, started out somewhere. Who knows, this may be my start.Victoria Justice: Beatles Tee at LAX

Posted to: Victoria JusticeIt was about mid-day that the earthquake hit Nepal. Saturday, 25th April, a day of rest. Sudeep Shah from Orient International Relocations was planning a relaxing day with his wife and daughter in Kathmandu: a visit to the temple followed by lunch somewhere nice.
The earthquake registered 7.8 on the Richter scale. Its epicentre was just 80km north-west of Kathmandu and its hypocentre just 15 km deep, shallow by comparison to some and very destructive. Kathmandu moved 10ft to the south in 30 seconds. 10,000 people died; 23,000 were injured; hundreds of thousands were left homeless. It was the worst natural disaster in the country for over 80 years.
“Suddenly the house started shaking like a matchbox,” said Sudeep. “The windows were rattling, the doors were banging, people were screaming. A 200kg refrigerator moved five feet across the floor. I can’t describe the feeling. We were terrified. We thought it was the last moments of our lives.”
Sudeep had experienced earthquakes before but nothing like this one. “This was just like a bomb exploding,” he said. “It went on for about 45 seconds, but time seemed to stop.” Then came the aftershocks, some almost as strong as the main quake, that kept everyone outside the buildings for safety. “They just kept on coming.” Asked for how long they had continued Sudeep said that the last one had been only two days earlier: 8th July, over two months after the initial shock. And they continue.
“People were running on the streets trying to find out if everyone was OK and sometimes finding that someone had died,” said Sudeep. “About 1 km from my house was a 300ft-high victory monument. It fell on the city killing 250 people.”
Miraculously Sudeep and his family were physically unharmed and his house undamaged. His company too escaped without serious damage although everything had been thrown around the offices.
For a day the situation was very confused. Then Sudeep received a call from Care International (an international non-government organisation) saying that supplies were coming into the airport and that his help was needed. “There was only the Nepalese army at the airport; no customs people. We could only identify the flights by their call signs.”
But the aid came in from all over the world and Sudeep, his son Sudev and their crews worked tirelessly to distribute it to the people who needed it most. Normal business was on hold. There was no Internet or power for a week. Sudeep’s only connection to the world was his Blackberry which miraculously was functional and was charged by the car charger. All his trucks were switched to relief work. “We felt it was our duty to save our nation first,” he said. At the time of writing Orient International had already distributed 3,800 tonnes of building materials and essential supplies. The work continues.
Inside the old city of Kathmandu there are still hundreds of people living in tents and everything is badly damaged. In the outlying villages the problem is worse. It’s the most mountainous region on earth. Relief work is slow. Now it’s started raining, roads are slippery, even tractors can’t get through, and the helicopters, provided by foreign governments at the height of the crisis, have returned to their bases.
But for Sudeep and his men the work continues and he is very grateful for all the help that his country received from outside. “I must thank all of the volunteers and the governments who have come to Nepal to help,” he said. “They give their time and effort and put their lives in danger. They are still working here. I met many wonderful people from different countries. One, a Care volunteer from Lebanon, Joseph Abdo, worked 18 hours a day, he didn’t sleep. This is what motivates us. People trying to help without any monetary interest. We are really thankful to them.”
Asked what others can do to help now, Sudeep said that he believes that the bad time is over. “But we still need help to support the victims in the villages,” he said. “I ask that people continue to donate to the aid agencies such as Care, the Red Cross and Action Aid, because they will make sure the help gets to where it’s needed.” Beyond that Sudeep said that they needed nothing more than our good wishes.
Rebuilding Nepal will be a long process. It’s a beautiful but poor country that has been ruined by bad politics. But Sudeep has an important message for everyone that the disaster has brought into clear focus for him. “Despite all the terrible things that are happening in the world, natural or otherwise, I want you to know that humanity still prevails over trouble.”
May it always remain so. And on behalf of the rest of the global moving industry Sudeep, be assured, you have our good wishes.

In let lie\, an excerpt from a collaborative work by Elizabeth Rainer and Michael Blouin, we are given glimpses into pieces which were written over a period of a year and a half and emailed back and forth:

Here, Rainer and Blouin successfully combine masculine and feminine language and metaphor in an ongoing collaboration which mixes and juxtaposes contrasting identities into a string of textual and contextual and allegorical narratives.
Stephen Brockwell’s Excerpts from Impossible Books: The Crawdad Cantos Brockwell at his poetic height:
“Brockwell, you’re a fool, thrilled by a sunset
‘beyond words.’ The sunset is beyond; but
beyond words? No. Words for it outpace you.
God bless impala words you’ll never speak.”
Here’s what I posted — you can slag it too:
Watched gorgeous sunset from window on flight
to LAX. Beyond words. Tried anyway.
“from Messages from Imaginary Friends: Karikura and the Inarticulate Sunset”
Lastly, there is the controlled musicality and the experimental narrative quality in rob mclennan’s Sextet: six poems from Songs for little sleep, which draws the reader inside by using repeated phrasings of short sentences and brief staccato rhythms:
1.
The gathering place of something, we. I can’t recall. It was I who called, who called, who.
Watch the moon, full, you must. You must, we. We are watching the full moon, full of something. Was full, of only, possibly ourselves. Only full.
We were watching the moon we were.
from “The learning curve that sometimes manages, itself”
All three of these titles offer varying glimpses of excerpts, collaborations, and works-in-progress not found elsewhere by poets just reaching the height of their craft. In these above/ground press chapbooks they practice a high wire literary act. Sometimes failing. More often than not, though, succeeding brilliantly. It takes guts to write without a net, and particularly to publish those early efforts for all to see. Guts, indeed.

You know me, dear readers. For recreational purposes, I study statistics. I find perusing data to be very relaxing. Go figure.
That abruptly changed at (of all places) St. Mary’s Cathedral in Fall River. The venue has personal significance. It was there that I was ordained a priest and from there sent out to preach, to teach, and to evangelize.
I was attending a presentation by Deacon Joe Regali, director of the Diocesan Office of Pastoral Planning. All of us priests were there. On the screen was projected a series of statistics. One statistic in particular nearly knocked me out of my pew. Here’s that shocking fact: It is scientifically proven that I live in a Godless state. Not me personally, you understand, but all of us in the state of Massachusetts. New England is bad enough in matters of faith, but studies have proven that citizens of Massachusetts value faith less than all the other states in the nation. Sixty percent of the residents of Massachusetts say they don’t even believe in God. When it comes to faith, Massachusetts ranks dead last. I am not making this up. Although the currency we use proclaims “In God We Trust,” more than half of us don’t.
We live in a time in desperate need of a New Evangelization worldwide, but in Massachusetts we happen to be at the epicenter of Godlessness. Who knew?
I’m of an age to remember the “old evangelization.” I remember the mighty efforts of outreach going on across the Diocese of Fall River: the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, the Knights of Columbus, the Legion of Mary, the Sodality of Mary, the Children of Mary, college Newman Centers, Chi-Rho Clubs, ECHO and Emmaus youth retreats, Cursillo adult retreats, the Catholic Youth Organization, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Holy Name Society, and similar organizations. Each group had a penchant for evangelization. These organizations were (and are) led by highly-motivated lay people. Priests always worked closely with them.
I also vaguely remember a diocesan evangelization effort back in the early 1980s. It was called “We Care/ We Share,” I think. Catholics for the first time were invited to work together across parish lines. The objective was to visit every single home in the neighborhood and to invite every single person to a local event tailored to their own particular social or religious interests. There were neighborhood events for everyone: for the simply curious, for the unchurched Catholics, for other Christians, for non-Christians, for divorced and remarried Catholics. Advanced publicity across the diocese included radio spots, newspaper ads, bumper stickers, massive amounts of printed materials (bilingual), and many organizational sessions. On one Sunday afternoon, 10,000 trained home visitors were sent door-to-door all across the diocese. “We are the Catholic Church. We Care/We Share” — that was the message. “To all our friends and neighbors, come and see” — that was the personal invitation. While we were at it, we also took a census of self-identified Catholics.
Times have changed. The Church must change, too. In this diocese, we have a faithful past, but what about the future?
Here are more statistics on the diocese, based on parish self-reporting over a decade:
— Baptisms — down 48 percent (nationally, down 25 percent)
— First Communions — down 16 percent (nationally, down 10 percent)
— Confirmations — down 24 percent (nationally, down seven percent)
— Marriages — down 47 percent (nationally, down 28 percent)
In the Diocese of Fall River, over the past five years the number of parishioners has dropped barely five percent but Mass attendance is down 41 percent and Religious Education is off by 27 percent. Here is the church. Here is the steeple. Open the doors but where are the people? “The only option we don’t have is to do nothing,” observes Bishop Edgar M. da Cunha, S.D.V.
The bishop has asked for feedback from parishioners of all ages throughout the diocese. The project is called “Rebuilding in Faith and Hope.” The purpose is to assist the bishop in leading the diocesan Church into the future. It’s a sort of “virtual town meeting.” Answering the questions online will take an estimated 15 minutes. Printed versions are available for those without Internet access, as are trilingual materials. The questions deal with five areas: Sacramental life, Catholic Faith Formation, community, serving those in need, and effective administration. The data will be reported back to the Parish Core Team. The deadline for input is May 31, 2016.
Every parish has a designated core group to analyze the data received, craft a plan of action, and propose a parish and/or regional strategy for the bishop’s prayerful consideration. This pastoral task force is composed of the pastor, perhaps a ministerial associate, Parish Pastoral Council members, Parish Finance Council members, and other parish lay leaders.
Then it will be on to a hopeful future. As the bishop puts it, “We will move from maintenance mode to mission mode.” I find these both challenging and exciting times to be a priest.

Bush's Coalition Of The Tiny Wants Payback
by Ed Holt and Martina Pisarova
President George W. Bush has promised money and a role in helping rebuild Iraq, but some analysts say a strong relationship with the U.S. will be prized as much as financial rewards.
"The question of support was not a matter of calculation," says Alexander Duleba, foreign policy expert at the Slovak Foreign Policy Association. "That would be a very superficial position to take. Whether or not there will be a couple of million dollars for backing the action against Iraq, or whether firms from these countries get some reconstruction contracts in Iraq were a long way down the list of reasons such a stance was taken."
The countries of central Europe, such as Slovakia, acted in their national interest "because as small countries with a Communist past they are more vulnerable than the world's superpowers," he said. "It is in their interest to be a part of strong organizations, including the European Union and NATO."
Ten central and east European states officially backed the U.S.-led military action in Iraq, with several providing logistic and military support by opening airspace and allowing U.S. troops to use their airbases.
In a meeting with Slovak President Rudolf Schuster in Washington on April 9, Bush told Schuster that Slovakia would have a role to play in rebuilding Iraq.
Slovakia was allocated $6 million for its support. Slovak firms are now hoping to bid as suppliers to some of the larger international firms which will win contracts to help reconstruct the battered country.
Other East European nations are following suit. About 500 Polish companies have expressed an interest in public works and oil industry contracts. Some Polish firms want to get back more than $700 million owed to them from road construction in Iraq in the 1980s.
Romania wants its pre-Gulf War I debts of $1.7 billion paid back. The Czech Republic is hoping for contracts to equip the Iraqi army and police force, drawing on its experience of modernizing its own Soviet-era equipment with U.S. aid.
The government in Slovakia has focussed on business opportunities. The Slovak Economy Ministry has said post-conflict contracts for reconstruction would be good business for them. President Schuster has been quick to claim that any contracts could help reduce the nation's 17 per cent unemployment.
"We can contribute with production and development of military systems in which we have good experience," Schuster told Bush. "A lot of jobs can thus be created in Slovakia."
"Reconstruction is always a huge investment and export opportunity," says Milan Sikuta, head of the Institute of Slovak and World Economy at the Slovak Academy of Sciences.
But Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda will be looking also for less tangible rewards for his decision to back the U.S. -- a decision that went not only against a number of powerful states in the European Union, which Slovakia will join next year, but against the opinion of the majority of the country's five million people.
The U.S. is expected to recognize that. "Naturally the U.S. took note of Slovakia's position and appreciated it," says Duleba. "If countries share common positions in conflicts, it increases the ties between them."
The aspiring members from Eastern Europe were described as "primitive" by French President Jacques Chirac before the war for their support for the military action.
But their stand has almost certainly strengthened their hands in NATO, and may have speeded the resumption of dialogue between the U.S. and Europe. "From the U.S. point of view this stance shows them who are the allies they have in Europe," says Duleba.

(Translated from Spanish by Rakel Rodriguez-Alvarez)
1. Information and opinion are special goods, inherent to the conditions of life in society. For that reason journalists are responsible not only to editors but also to society for the information and opinions that they transmit. For this:
(a) They assume responsibility to interpret the truth, make it clear in order to make sure that people from the social sectors comprehend.
(b) They procure the co-existence of democracy justly and harmoniously with respect to human rights, fighting against all forms of corruption.
(c) Contribute their knowledge and capacity to defend the nature of things and balance the systems of that which life operates.
2. In their professional work journalist must contribute to principles, to the truth and to equanimity and will break professional ethics when they stay silent, falsify or distort the facts. They should supply the public with elements of context pertaining to the matter, together with different aspects of the subject so that the recipient of the material can interpret for themselves the origins and perspective of the facts.
3. In divulging ideas and opinions, journalists should promote the creation of conditions in order to express themselves democratically and not be restricted by commercial interest, publicity, or other influences.
4. Journalists are responsible for their information and opinions. They will accept the right to retort and respect the professional secrets relating to the source of information.
5. Offensive actions to professional ethics:
* Plagiarism and loss of respect to intellectual property
* Acceptance of back-handers, bribery or extortion
* Omission of information of collective interest
* Defamation, slander, damaging insult
* Sensationalism
* To play a part in any form of persecution or social, political, religious, racial or sexual discrimination
6. Journalists and society.
The character of the profession demands that journalists accept and promote the circulation of ideas and opinions so that they contribute to the building of a pluralistic and participatory society. On the same lines they should participate and collaborate with different social sectors, especially minorities, so their voices are heard through these mediums of information.
7. Journalists should always maintain respect and dignity to people’s private lives. Avoiding being tempted by the possibility of invading one’s intimacy offered by reasons of new technological advances.
For this they will be guided by law and the internationally recognised tools of their trade. The exception to the rule of divulgence of private acts is permitted, for reasons of public sanctions, the necessity to shield the integrity of civil servants or when in private one’s physical or psychological rights are violated.
8. Journalists must safeguard the innocence of the accused until the courts have passed sentence. At the same time they should abstain from identifying victims of sexual crimes whatever their age or social condition without their consent. The same applies to minors that might have participated in a crime.
9. Journalists should actively contribute to public health and defend the ecological balance necessary to human life and they should report events that are responsible for contamination and destruction of the environment.
10. Journalists should promote cultural values and national identity without chauvinism. Special interest should be demonstrated in the valuable use of “Guarani” and “Jopará” (translation of these terms unknown).
11. Journalists and their equals.
Journalists should strengthen the organisations and the syndicate union association, and should contribute to create them wherever they do not exist, and they should join the country’s labour movement.
12. Journalists should always be in solidarity with their colleagues, especially with the ones who suffer persecution or aggression caused by their professional work.
13. A journalist is especially forbidden to discredit fellow journalists, either by personal disqualification or professional discredit.
14. Journalists and commercial enterprises.
Journalists are united to companies by obligations derived from work contracts. Journalists will try to make contracts in a collective manner and to welcome union decisions. At the same time they will be responsible for their work, respecting these code ethics, the duties pointed out in the national constitution and the republic laws of Paraguay.
15. Journalists must demand from the companies respect for their beliefs, ideas and opinions, together with material that they submit as a product of their work. They shall not let the companies change the meaning of the information materials handed in under their own signature.
16. Journalists will assume together with the companies the responsibility that all information gathered by them shall be circulated without any alteration against the wishes of the editor. Journalists have the right to withdraw their signature from any information if they consider it not to be exact, an incorrect declaration of a third party, or if substantial changes were made unjustly.
17. Journalists should fight to obtain the right to control the execution and manufacture of the informative and editorial politics in the medium in which they work.
18. Journalists must claim their right to express their points of view in the “Opinion Section” in the medium in which they work, even when their ideas do not coincide with the company’s editorial politics.
19. Journalists must demand from their company the right treatment according to their human dignity. Also, they must demand recognition of the importance and value of their job in society.
20. It is clear that the simultaneous practice of journalism and publicity are incompatible. Journalists should always achieve a rigorous and formal distinction between information and publicity in order not to induce the receiver to error or confusion.Facebook share Tweet This Email this

The Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) formed as part of a major realignment among US Presbyterians, who had been divided on regional grounds since the Civil War, between the southern PCUS and the northern-based UPCUSA. Yet the two regional denominations were also internally divided between theological liberals and conservatives. As momentum slowly built toward unification of the two regional denominations, conservative pastors and lay leaders became alarmed by the PCUS’s drift from orthodoxy and historic confessional and biblical standards of the church. By the 1970s, conservative pastors in the PCUS began to plan an exit from the denomination. This was the Presbyterian Churchmen United, formed by more than five hundred ministers, and the group published a statements of their beliefs in thirty newspapers. They sought to reaffirm the Westminster Confession of Faith as the fullest and clearest exposition of biblical faith and to call all pastors and leaders to affirm the inerrancy of Scripture. They also felt that the church should disavow the ordination of women.
The PCUS was a mostly conservative denomination until more liberal elements gained control in the 1950s. Conservative Presbyterians felt that presbyteries violated the Westminster Confession of Faith by receiving ministers who refused to affirm the virgin birth and the bodily resurrection of Christ, while also denying membership to faithful ministers.
In December 1973, delegates representing 260 congregations with a combined communicant membership of more than forty-one thousand who had left the PCUS (Southern) gathered at Briarwood Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama, and organized the National Presbyterian Church. In 1974 they changed their name to the Presbyterian Church in America. These churches separated from the Southern Presbyterian Church in opposition to the long-developing theological liberalism which denied the deity of Jesus Christ and the inerrancy and authority of Scripture. In addition, the PCA held that the traditional position on the role of women in church offices was the biblical position.
During the 1970s, the denomination added a significant number of congregations outside the South when several UPCUSA churches in Ohio and Pennsylvania joined. This move was precipitated by a case regarding an ordination candidate denied by the Pittsburgh Presbytery because he refused to support women’s ordination, a decision which was upheld by the UPCUSA General Assembly. had also invited the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC) and the Reformed Presbyterian Church to the merger. A second invitation to the OPC was extended in 1986 but not accepted.
Present
The PCA is one of the faster growing denominations in the United States, having experienced steady growth since its founding in 1973. In 2012 the PCA had 1,777 congregations, 1,474 particular churches, 303 mission churches, and a membership of 364,019 with 4,321 ordained ministers, representing all fifty US states, the District of Columbia, and five Canadian provinces. More than 200 churches of the denomination are ethnic Korean.
The Presbyterian Church in America has a strong commitment to evangelism, missionary work at home and abroad, and Christian education. From its inception, the church has determined its purpose to be “faithful to the Scriptures, true to the reformed faith, and obedient to the Great Commission.”
Missions
The PCA has its own agency for sending missionaries around the world, which has about six hundred foreign missionaries working in about sixty nations. Mission to North America serves PCA churches and presbyteries through the development of evangelism and church planting in Canada and the US. An average of three new churches are planted in a month in the two nations; currently there are three hundred mission churches in the US alone. More than 40 percent of all congregations are less than twenty-five years old, due to church planting. The PCA puts into the field the world’s largest Presbyterian mission force.
Theological Institutions
The PCA has its own ministry to students on college campuses, Reformed University Fellowship; its own camp and conference center, the Ridge Haven Conference and Retreat Center in Brevard, North Carolina; its own liberal arts college, Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, Georgia; and its seminary, Covenant Theological Seminary, located in Saint Louis, Missouri. The PCA also publishes its own denominational magazine, By Faith.
Headquarters
The church maintains headquarters in Lawrenceville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. The site was once the headquarters of the PCUS, but all offices of the united PC(USA) were moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1988. The PCA ministry buildings in Lawrenceville are the location from which the ministries of the denomination are coordinated.
Relations with Other Reformed Churches
The PCA is a member of NAPARC and of the World Reformed Fellowship, a worldwide organization of churches in which Reformed, Presbyterian, and Reformed Baptist denominations, congregations, and individuals can also participate. It is a member of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE).
The Presbyterian Church in America enjoys fraternal relations with the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. In 2008 the Presbyterian Church of Brazil and the PCA entered into full fraternal relationship with each other. The National Presbyterian Church in Mexico and the PCA also work together in missions and evangelizing. In 1994 The Fellowship of Reformed Churches was formed and was a product of the dialogue between the PCA, the Presbyterian Church in Brazil, and the National Presbyterian Church in Mexico. They decided to invite other Latin American Reformed churches to the fellowship.
PCA missionaries have helped found the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in England and Wales, the Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Ukraine, the Christian Presbyterian Church in Portugal, the Evangelical Presbyterian Reformed Church in Colombia, the Africa Evangelical Presbyterian Church, the Westminster Presbyterian Church of Australia, and the Presbyterian Church in America, Chile.
Perhaps the most well-known personalities of the PCA are R. C. Sproul, who is a minister of that denomination and founder and chairman of Ligonier Ministries; and the late D. James Kennedy, founder of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Marnie
Marnie
Diagnosed August 28, 2009, at the age of 5, with Stage IV Wilms Tumor.
Marnie started Kindergarten on Tuesday, August 25, 2009. She rode the school bus home on the second and third day. Marnie thought it was the second most exciting thing ever - the most exciting event being the Coldplay concert she attended earlier that month.
We took Marnie to the Emergency Room at 9:30 pm on Thursday night with stomach pains. We were expecting to hear she had appendicitis. An X-ray, Ultrasound, CT scan and 5 1/2 hours later, we heard the words that shattered our world. Our precious, perfectly healthy daughter had a Wilms Tumor in her right kidney and the cancer had metastasized into her lungs. The largest spot in Marnie's right lung was the size of a golf ball. Marnie's treatment protocol involves 2 rounds of chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, surgery to remove her right kidney, 8 days of radiation and 9 additional rounds of chemotherapy. Marnie's last scheduled chemotherapy round was April 26, 2009.
We have watched Marnie become a strong, brave, determined little girl. This has changed our lives forever. We are better people because of Marnie. We are determined to fight for Marnie. We are determined to fight for all present and future childhood cancer patients. These children need our love and financial support for a cure. The children do not need your pity. Talk to the next cancer kid you see instead of staring or looking away quickly. They will touch your heart and you will never be the same. Please join the fight to find a cure.

Here's a nice looking deal that popped up on craigslist yesterday. This van is a 1984 VW Vanagon Westfalia camper with stock 1.9L engine, stock manual transmission and 143k miles on the clock. If it runs and drives well without leaks or getting too hot, this appears to be a sweet deal on a entry level water cooled Westy. Not many other details are provided, but the seller did provide the VIN (WV2ZB0250EH076385) so you can check up on the history of this rig. The seller states the interior is great, but the exterior needs work. There's only picture, so we're not quite sure how much "work" is needed, thought the original two tone paint job looks to be in decent shape. Find it for sale near Medford, Oregon with an asking price of only $6,500. Craigslist Link

Hi!:) I’m looking for a vw and I’m in love with this. Could you e-mail me for it please?This one will have to be quick as I must must must vaccum the downstairs-- it's my only shot while the kiddo sleeps.
So, here goes:
Who knows...
-Why icecubes are sticky?
-Why moisture in the air can make us colder or hotter?
-Why my son went to sleep with a small tin cup in one hand and a train in the other?
-What toxic goo is on movie popcorn and why people want to replicate this taste at home?
-Where all the scissors have gone and why I end up cutting things with nail scissors even though we own 5 pairs of normal ones?
-Why we are so addicted to bubbles in our beverages? (I mean, I drink carbonated water, for God's sakes)
-Why I read People magazine even though I don't give a rat's ass about most celebrities?
-Why real letters, left in the mailbox, are so gratifying?
-Why two separate people who we don't know shoveled our walk this morning (one with a shovel, the other with a snowblower)?
-Why untouched snow is so satisfying, and why disturbed snow is almost repugnant?
-Why boys are so attracted to things with wheels almost as soon as they set foot outside the womb?
-Why I continue to eat things at the computer even though I've already ruined one keyboard?
-Why anyone would read the book "The Piano Player", enjoy it, and then want to see the movie?
-Why the two hours my son is napping a day are more delicious than any other time by myself?
You should be so delicious, too. Try it. Who knows?

Well, I can't really answer all of these, but I can help with some.
--Icecubes are sticky because the moisture on your skin freezes on contact with them, making your skin "stick" to the icecube. Same principle as getting your tongue stuck to a flagpole or other metal in winter.
-- Moisture in the air effects how easily moisture on our body can evaporate. Evaporation always cools you off, and makes you feel cold in winter. It also makes you feel cool in summer, but if the air is already super-saturated with moisture-- "muggy"-- there is nowhere for the moisture on your skin to go. The air can't absorb it, and hence there is no evaporation and subsequent cooling.
-- Because he's three.
-- Dunno, but it tastes good.
-- Because you use a scissors to alter something else, and once you have done so, you continue to work on the something else. You usually don't bother putting the scissors back right away, and often it never gets back to its "home".
-- Cause it's so FIZZY!
-- Habit?
-- Nostalgia? Perhaps because it involves senses other than just sight? The tactile feel and solidity of the letter gives it greater value?
-- People in Wisconsin are nice.
-- I don't find disturbed snow repugnant, so I can't help with that. Untouched snow simply looks beautiful and pure.
-- Good question.
-- Habit.
-- Dunno, never heard of it.
-- Dunno, but enjoy them while they last. They grow out of naps quickly.According to an interpretation at “The Cabinet” “Milford High School has received a generally good report from the regional school accreditation agency, although it noted areas of concern, including a school building that is failing in several areas.” We found…

The most common source of gluten is wheat products (bread, crackers, croutons, pizza crust, cake, pies, cookies, tortillas, and so on). It seems, too, that since we have been eating genetically modified wheat (GMO), the problem has become more widespread and severe. Oh, you didn’t know you were eating GMO wheat? You are, unless your wheat source is organically grown. There are also unrecognizable sources of gluten, such as vanilla extract and many shampoos and skin care products. Other grains also have some gluten in them. You can see, if you are type O, B, or AB that you have been eating food that has been hurting you. Your body has the ability to adapt. As you get older, your ability to adapt to this food (that is more like poison than food to you) diminishes. You start to have trouble. Irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, constipation, diarrhea, all of these can be symptoms of gluten intolerance. You may even be diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, Celiac or Sprue, diseases caused by gluten intolerance. The gluten actually damages the inside of your colon so the only choice you have, if you want to regain your health, is to avoid all wheat and other grains that contain gluten. Educate yourself so that you can truly protect your health and not be “accidentally” poisoned by eating something with hidden gluten.
Remember that your ability to absorb nutrients when your colon is under stress is limited. You may be eating well and starving at the same time. Once you’ve identified your problem, start adding nutritional supplements to your diet. You need to catch up. Look for the words “gluten free” or “wheat free” on your supplement label, too.
Here are some things you can do to help yourself. If you have colon problems such as described above you will want to repopulate your colon with good bacteria, a probiotic. This will also help regulate any bowel irregularities for you.
With the strain you’ve already put on your digestive system, we strongly recommend you follow the food guidelines in the bookEat Right 4 Your Type. Eating the recommended healthy foods for your blood type will insure a quick recovery.
If you have diarrhea, you may find a “round” of Cats Claw and Sarsaparilla caps will stop the diarrhea. See other suggestions under the heading “Diarrhea.” Cats claw by itself is very healing for a damaged colon.If you haven't experienced Barcelona's Fiestas de Gracia, then you're in for a treat. Every year, at the end of August, the Gracia neighborhood lights up, goes crazy and stays awake 24/7. Each street competes to have the wildest designs, the most innovative themes and the most elaborate decor.
This is undoubtedly one of Barcelona's most intense competitions, with teams starting to plan months or even a year in advance. In addition to the street parties, the entire neighborhood of Gracia runs rampant with live bands and entertaining booths for children and adults. Other features include special foods, free drinks and an overall extremely exciting atmosphere.
Fiestas de Gracia — Photo courtesy of Jared Goralnick
Even though each Barcelona neighborhood has its own party throughout the year, Gracia's festivals somehow take the cake. What was once a city unto itself, Gracia has that unique flavor and special touch. It's a place where you can feel the locals’ loyalty to their barrio ("neighborhood") and to its restaurants, its bars, its shops, its people and its grand celebrations.
The Gracia Fiestas take place the last two weeks of August. This is a definite must-see attraction if you're in town during this time in summer, as the celebration is a sight unlike any other.

The last few days have been a whirlwind. I had a friend say that I’m going through hell, and I don’t buy that. It’s been challenging both emotionally and physically for sure. But the reality is, everyone will come out the stronger for it.
On Thursday, Traci went in to see her doctors because her Hickman Catheter site was infected. It actually appeared a few weeks back, but then antibiotics began to clear up the infection. But once the antibiotics had run there course, the site became infected again, and the doctors wanted to pull it out. (In case you don’t know what a Hickman is, check it out here). The reality is, a Hickman should only be in for 6-8 months before they should be removed because of the risk of infection. Traci’s had hers for well over a year. It was just time to remove it.
The hospital was full however. So instead of admitting her, and getting her a room, they sent her down to the ER to wait in the hall with everyone else who has a whooping cough and the swine flu. Turns out, that’s not so good for someone with a compromised immune system (another attribute incurred from cancer patients having undergone Chemo), and we fought to get a room. The nurses were actually really great and stole a room for us as soon as one became available. The reality was, the hallways were lined with patients because the ER was so jam-packed. So getting a room was really a luxury.
But there in the ER, Traci sat. We waited, and waited for availability in the OR to remover the Hickman, and they kept coming in and saying “there was a trauma, and we couldn’t get you in.” Or, “we just had to bump you, and you’ll have to wait a little longer.” It was frustrating as her last meal was at 11AM on Thursday. Finally, I left at 4AM Friday morning because I still had to get the kids to school.
Friday came and went, and I got done with work and picked up the kids from Girl Scouts and dropped them at home with Traci’s grandparents. When I got back to the hospital at around 7PM, I found out that Traci had still not been offered anything to eat. I took out my anger at the Doctors and the Nurses there in the ER. Right there in the Nurses Station, I very loudly began to berate them for their lack of care, their inability to pay attention to a patient, and their sheer neglect for Traci as a person. It had been over 30 hours and she hadn’t been offered anything to eat. It was unacceptable, and I lost it. I screamed at the Doctors that they were Hitler, running this show and treating these patients worse than Jews in a concentration camp. I demanded that they get on the line with surgery and either get her in there now, or let her eat. The latter took place in moments.
On Saturday morning, Traci was set to have the IR attempt to install a new Pick line. This was difficult simply because prior to getting the Hickman, the doctors preferred that she get a Pick Line. But because the Graph vs. Host disease has attacked her skin so violently, and because her veins are so small, a Pick line was nearly impossible to install. After several failed attempts the last time, the physicians and surgeons finally relented and agreed to install the Hickman. Fortunately this time, a good vein was found on her right bicep, and after several tries, the surgeon finally was able to install the line. And later that evening, she went into the OR to have the infected Hickman Catheter removed.
Everything went smoothly. Traci was incredible through it all. She had a really positive attitude saying things like “well, thank goodness it was this weekend. I’d rather have it now than over Emma’s birthday, or the Wedding, or the Bridal Shower.” I couldn’t believe how great she was. There was of course the occasional crying, and there were plenty of complaints about the eating (or lack there of), but overall, I was amazed by her positive attitude and positive outlook on the whole situation. It was encouraging.
I also want to thank all of my friends who kept asking about how things were going, both through text and on twitter. It was extremely peaceful to have those positive affirming messages come through, just checking on us both. Your thoughts and prayers were absolutely felt, welcomed, and totally appreciated.
Mother’s Day was a day of recovery from the procedures. Traci is today in bright spirits. I brought her kids in to see her and visit for a while along with a Mom’s Day flower arrangement. It was a good time.
Now that things have settled down, I’m hopeful that Traci will be home by Tuesday. And the healing should have come far enough along that we can resume some form of normalcy. I’m missing that at the moment. I don’t like coming home to an empty house, or sleeping in a bed alone. I miss my partner. And I’ll be happy to have her home.
Some takeaways from all of this, a moral if you will; I’m so appreciative of life. It’s something that I think that all of us take for granted. It’s a gift. The ability to simply exist every day, and the ability to love. There are so many trivial things that can affect us every day, and damper our moods and our outlooks on life. I think that it’s important that we remember that the fact that we’re here to begin with is a miracle itself. I came away from this weekend simply happy that I have so many loved ones in my life. Thankful that my children are healthy and happy. And thankful that the woman that I am going to marry is going to come home. Everything else just seems to me to be less important. I’m not worried about the fact that I’m still behind two months in pay from my employer. I’m not worried about the trivial things in life. I intend on focusing on those items that bring about joy in my life, and that of others.

Ciao from Italy! What, you guys thought I wouldn’t stick around, even when I’m thousands of miles away? Oh, that’s funny. Here I am, still going to give you lovely advice and whatnot. You all ready? Here it goes.
Officially, I’ve been in Italy for almost three weeks. Honestly, I thought I would be more homesick than I am. Of course, I miss my family and friends and cats, but it is beautiful here. I catch myself just looking around everywhere and thinking, “This is where I’m living until April.” The whole situation is still surreal. I’m living in history right now. Like, what? I can’t believe that I’m here. So far, my experience has been amazing.
I’ve met some really awesome people. I’ve got friends from the United States, Brazil, Holland, Italy, Korea, Afghanistan and Germany. The words and phrases I’ve learned in other languages is ridiculous. This is definitely more than I bargained for, and I couldn’t be happier. It’s so strange that I feel close with these people already. I have a little family: we do dinners and go out together, do homework and drink while watching “Friends.” What more could I ask for?
The best part, so far, has been the traveling. I haven’t been to crazy places yet (don’t worry, I am planning on it), but I have traveled to Assisi and Florence. No matter how often I hear about these places, it is still breathtaking and mind-blowing. When I went to Florence, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. First, I saw Florence Cathedral, or Il Duomo, which is beautiful and absolutely amazing. The detail of the building is unbelievable (to tell you the truth, I am running out of synonyms for the word beautiful).
I got to see La Nascita di Venere (The Birth of Venus) by Botticelli. I was so surprised and ecstatic to see it. I was talking with my Brazilian friend, Carina, about how crazy it is that there has been no one as substantial or influential as Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Michelangelo. To be in the presence of their works and to walk on the streets where they walked… I cannot even process it all. When I saw Michelangelo’s David, I thought the statue was going to come to life and walk away. It was so beautiful.
As for how I’m feeling, it is like I’ve been here my whole life. Sure, I might be in some honeymoon stage, but I highly doubt it. I’m in Italy! How could I ever just accept the fact that I am in this amazing country? I still cannot believe it, but I know that I just have to let everything flow and let this experience be what it’s going to be. You all know I’m pretty crazy, and Italy lets me be me, which is great.
Just so everyone knows, I am doing wonderful and great. Who knows how I’ll be next week, but all I know is that I’m going to Siena this weekend and I’m ready to have a good time! Have a great semester everyone! I know yours has just started, so do well and have fun. I know I will. And as a side note, I seriously miss everyone and I cannot wait to see all of you in April, but I will not be wishing for my time to go by fast. Arrivaderci!We’re pleased to announce that the Plague Bearer is once again available in kit form through Modular Addict and Thonk.

Sorry for the wait,
Kevin
First, my apologies to all for the current widespread unavailability of f(h) products from dealers and the long silence from myself. I have been busy building the combined stock orders and they should be available once again very soon – I hope to have it all finished within the next two weeks.
However, I have been spending so much time concentrating on this order that I now find myself a mite low on funds and need to pay some bills, so it is time for a pre-order sale! I am now taking orders for the following items:
All orders must be prepaid to get the discount. Lead time for prepaid orders is 6-8 weeks, depending on number of orders and place in the queue.
Please send inquiries to flight@flightofharmony.com, orders can be placed via PayPal to paypal@flightofharmony.com.
We just received an email from a Flight of Harmony user named Bennett Williams alerting us to their album ‘Recognizer‘, which gratitously features the Infernal Noise Machine. For a link to their Soundcloud page featuring the album, click here. If you wonder ‘how in Hades did they get such wonderful drones, such strange percussion and create the sound of a thousand angry hornets’ – here is their creative process:
The [Infernal Noise Machine] had all of its CV inputs coming from both a Moog MP-201 CV pedal, and a Moog Etherwave Theremin Plus. Then I ran the audio through a Boomerang looper. Essentially what you are hearing are loops of the Infernal Noise Machine on top of itself many times over, all as I am changing parameters and creating new loops as I go.
We love to hear about how our customers are using (and abusing) our gear and what they create with it.
Thank you, Bennett.

What could be better than combining the widest-throw joystick controller in the Eurorack modular format with the myriad of outputs available from Grant Richter’s ‘Joystick Axis Generator‘, made available by Malekko Heavy Industry?
Nothing, Ray.

Before your product goes to market, you have to know that it is safe and that you've analyzed and mitigated every risk possible.
Jon Speer
The most important standard to know in Risk Management is ISO 14971. I reference it in all my work concerning Risk Management, and you should do the same. (Note: if you are developing for the European market, use EN ISO 14971:2012. It is essentially the same standard, but has a few important annexes.)
The Process of Risk Management
Medical device Risk Management requires top management involvement and that a company establish a Risk Management Policy.
The process itself includes:
- Risk Management Planning
- Risk Analysis
- Risk Evaluation
- Risk Controls
- Overall Residual Risk Acceptability
- Risk Management Report
- Production & Post-Production Information
The infographic below align directly to the ISO 14971 standard and is a high-level overview of Risk Management process.
If you are developing medical devices in this day and age, you absolutely must have an established Risk Management process defined, documented, and implemented.
Risk Management is an Enterprise-wide Process.
Risk Management needs to involve more than just engineers and product developers.
You need to include end-users, marketing, sales, business development, quality, regulatory, and manufacturing on your product Risk Management team.
Why?
All of these functional areas provide different perspectives and experiences for the medical devices you are designing, developing, and manufacturing.
It is important to ensure your Risk Management efforts are holistic.
Risk Management Starts at the Beginning
Risk Management is not a checkbox activity. If you don't take Risk Management seriously, you could endanger the end-users, which defeats the purpose of creating a medical device in the first place.
From day one, start your Risk Management process. Incorporate it closely with your Design Control process to increase efficiency and fully develop your products safely.
Jon Speer is the Founder & VP of QA/RA at greenlight.guru, a software company that produces beautifully simple quality and risk management software exclusively for medical device companies. He is also the founder of Creo Quality, a consultancy that specializes in assisting startup medical device companies with product development, quality systems, regulatory compliance & project management.Some good things about unemployment: being both able and expected to write all the time. Having the chance to paint and draw and wander and read and take photographs all over the place. A bad thing: having people ask me what I’m up to, telling them, and watching their faces mull it over in a moment of skepticism, confusion and disappointment. (Also bad: I have too much time to worry about what other people are thinking.) Recently, someone said, in response to my description of how I’m spending my time, “Oh. Well, if that’s okay for you.,” leaving me to wonder why people always think it’s appropriate to say messed up shit to me.
Yesterday I felt exhilarated about finally being able to control my time, that I’m actually being a writer always now, not just in the spare moments when I’m not doing my day job. Today I’m tired and grumpy, although I discovered the basement of the Starbucks on Court Street in Brooklyn, which is dark and cold and full of plugs, and I spent some quality time reading on my favorite bench, the one outside Book Court. Apparently, 3 in the afternoon on weekday is a good time to go there, the children have not yet commandeered the space.
Things I’m thinking about: how I wrote some words in a delicious tizzy the other day and now I can’t seem to make more of them, or make the existing words coalesce; Israel, which is rapidly approaching; how ridiculous it is that I can’t seem to feel optimistic two days in a row,; why my new pen loves to bleed through my journal pages; how strange it is that this recent cup of coffee refuses to do its job and make my thoughts shiny and snappy like a steel trap.
I’m at an impasse-am I not pushing hard enough? Am I not seeing what’s possible? The brutal truth here, I’m starting to realize, is that I have to figure this out for myself, and really not pay attention to people who have expectations for me that are different from those I have for myself. It’s weird to realize something that I’ve always believed. Lately, that seems to be the theme.TRAIN, world prices jack up gas price today - Manila Bulletin

(There appears to be something similar to the piece below on Cana News (15 Mar) on comments by the Reparation Committee chairman, but I don’t seem to be able to access this in full from the UK.)
I wanted to let you know we have therefore issued the following statement to the Observer, from a JCPC spokesman.
“The position of the JCPC is that its judges remain happy to serve the countries of the Caribbean region for as long as those countries wish to send appeals to them. This position is clearly articulated by Lord Neuberger, the current President of the JCPC, in the video messages that he has been asked to record and which are being shown as part of the public education campaign.
“This does not mean that the JCPC is seeking to influence the decision which the people of Antigua and Barbuda make as to whether to remain within its jurisdiction. The decision is solely for the people of Antigua and Barbuda.
“The JCPC has continued to hear broadly the same number of appeals from the Caribbean region over each of the last five years. For many years it has occasionally invited other judges to sit on appeals, and has continued this practice in recent years.
“Lord Phillips’ reported comments, made seven years ago during a wider profile interview, may or may not have reflected his personal view at the time.”
We hope this will help further inform the education campaign and ensure that the public understand the JCPC’s position.Garcinia Cambogia Is a Natural Weight Loss Product
Garcinia Cambogia is natural weight loss product. It is close to the top of the list of natural weight loss product in sales in the past few years. This natural supplement has received plenty of publicity since many studies have shown that it can assist people to lose weight.
Garcinia cambogia is the Latin name for a small tropical fruit that's found in Africa and India. it's a member of the citrus family, however it's too sour to eat like an orange or even a lemon. Garcinia cambogia`s rind is used as a spice in Indian cooking.
Some of us still eat even after we tend to feel full. This is often usually referred to as comfort or stress-related eating. Garcinia cambogia natural weight loss product will assist with this too becuase hydroxycitric acid (HCA) can give us a similar calming result that food produces.
Researchers into natural weight loss product extracted hydroxycitric acid from the garcinia cambogia fruit. They found that this substance may assist to reduce appetence, or more precisely, it will reduce a person's tendency to overeat. It triggers the signals that tell the brain when we ar full. This signaling mechanism is delayed in several overweight people therefore hydroxycitric acid are often can be effective for them. Some studies have found that the weight loss effects of HCA ar increased when it's combined with chromium as a supplement.
Many of us who overeat are found to own low levels of the essential mineral chromium, particularly as they get older. Therefore it's added to several natural weight loss product. chromium helps to manage the body's blood sugar levels and it should be useful for diabetics. However see your doctor before taking any supplements or natural weight loss product if you've got diabetes or other health conditions.
Most people taking natural weight loss product containing HCA follow a traditional diet while not eating any special foods. Actually, it helps if this is a healthy normal diet but not the hamburger-and-fries regime that a lot of people consider to be a normal diet in our society, but there aren't any prohibited foods.
Choose healthy foods and try to stop if you notice that you just feel full. This could be easier if you're taking HCA. There'll be moments when you need to eat and you're aware that your body doesn't actually need that food and you've got a selection. Learn to stop at that point most of the time, and that is however you may get the most benefit from HCA as a natural weight loss supplement.
See:Garcinia Cambogia for Weight Loss
Not all natural plant extracts ar healthy. Some will even be toxic, however HCA in the type of garcinia cambogia extract has been extensively tested and no side effects are identified for sure. Since it's a member of the citrus family, migraine and arthritis sufferers might notice a worsening of their symptoms that ar often sensitive to citrus. HCA shouldn't be taken by kids or by pregnant or nursing women without medical recommendation, however that's true of all natural weight loss product and other supplements.

Around the NFL writer
The Dallas Cowboys’ winning streak continued Thursday night against the Minnesota Vikings, but a Jason Witten franchise-record streak ended.
The tight end did not catch a pass for the first time in 130 games. The last time Witten went without a catch was Week 9, 2008, versus the New York Giants. It was the fourth-longest catch streak in the NFL behind Larry Fitzgerald (190), Brandon Marshall (155) and Steve Smith Sr. (138).
“Those records really don’t mean anything,” Witten said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. .”
Witten caught one pass in the third quarter, but a holding call on running back Ezekiel Elliott wiped out the play. The tight end officially ended the game with zero targets.
During his streak, which lasted 2,951 days, Witten caught 678 passes for 7,236 yards and 39 touchdowns.
To put the streak into perspective, the last game in which Witten didn’t catch a pass in Terrell Owens was still on the Cowboys, Brad Johnson and Brooks Bollinger were the Dallas quarterbacks that day, Plaxico Burress was a pre-prison Giant and Dak Prescott was 15 years old.
.”
While much has been made of Tony Romo’s future, the question of whether the end is near for Witten after 14 years is just as pertinent for a reliable 34-year-old finishing the final holes of his NFL round.Climate targets could lead to trillions of losses in oil, gas projects –report
If international climate targets are reached, oil firms including Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell could lose more than a third of their budgets on oil and gas projects that will not be feasible by 2025, according to a report by the Carbon Tracker think tank and a group of institutional investors.
More than US$2 trillion of planned investments in oil and gas projects by 2025 risk becoming redundant if governments stick to targets to lower carbon emissions to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, the report says.

Hi. It's 5 days until AFs due and I have been testing everyday for the past week, using superdrug and first response.
All have the same extremely faint line that appears after10mins. I know it's most likely an evap line, buttttttt all together I've taken at least 8. All with the same evaporation line.
So how common is it to have 8 evaps on FR and superdrug in the space of a week???
Thankyou xx
08/08/2015 at 17:57
Do you have a pic? It would be really strange to get Evaps on all of them? I've never had an evap, try waiting till AF is due & test then?
or if you're like me you'll keep testing twice a day! Lol. Good luck xx

Hmm, a few look pink to me, others I can't see & a couple look grey like an evap. I'm really not sure, I know first response are usually the best at picking it up early aren't they? So today, you'll have 4 days till AF?
do you have any more FR? I'd test again with one with FMU & see what happens? How many DPO are you?
Good luck xx

I think Redbox is a social experiment to see how much people are willing to endure to get something for one dollar. And people are willing to endure a lot. When someone's up at the box taking his or her good old time to pick out some shitty romantic comedy and the line starts to build up, the electricity in the air is as palpable as the moment right before the sky opens up and a summer storm unleashes itself. Only the storm never comes. Sure, people make a few audible sighs and groans, but situation always plays out without incident. There have been plenty of times when I've been waiting in line at a Redbox and the person selecting the movie actually seems to be testing the people in line, and I'll think, "Alright, this is it. Shit's about to go down. These people are gonna riot." And nothing ever happens ... yet. But it's only a matter of time until you turn on the news and hear, "It started out as family movie night and ended in cold-blooded murder. What happened at this Norristown Redbox will shock you."
The worst I've seen it was this winter. I'm standing in the Redbox line -- a line that's around 10 deep -- just trying to keep warm in the unheated lobby of Drexel Hill's Fresh Grocer. A heavyset, white trash woman in spandex is up at the box. While she carefully studies all of the available selections, her two dirty, obnoxious kids run around the lobby unsupervised like a couple of rabid squirrels. Not satisfied that she can make the big decision on her own, this woman gets on her phone and starts reading off the descriptions to the person on the other line.
White Trash Lady: "Eat, Pray, Love ... whatta ya think? What's it about? Let's see, it says here that 'Liz Gilbert' ... that's Julia Roberts' name in the movie. Umm, it says, this Liz Gilbert 'is a modern woman on a quest to marvel at and travel the world while rediscovering and reconnecting with her true inner self.'"
This women read off full descriptions of movies, while we froze our asses of waiting in line, and no one did shit. But if someone did end up doing something, I guarantee there would be an eyewitness on the news that night saying, "That was horrible what happened to that woman ... but she kinda had it coming."Newsletter Curriculum Pathways Info Houses Library Staff Vacancies Careers

Madison Sweitzer added seven points and 10 rebounds for the Blue Devils, who improved to 4-0 on the year.
G-A established a 16-8 advantage by the end of the first quarter before taking a 24-18 cushion into the half. The scoring slowed in the third prior to the Blue Devils netting 14 in the fourth to close out the win.
"We had a decent start and then were able to maintain the lead," G-A head coach Mike Rhine said. "It was another pretty close game though, which we expect a lot of those. It's a process for us, but we'll take being 4-0."
Lydia Crist contributed eight points in the victory while Heidi Schanzenbacher finished with six. Faulkner also registered nine rebounds and six steals.
"We got contributions from several different girls which is definitely a good thing," Rhine said. "Jenay was her consistent self and we had girls chipping in. We're playing hard and it's always nice to win on the road."
The Blue Devils face another tough road test with a trip to Boiling Springs on Wednesday.droid stock pvr stack:

Where did my muse go?
My imagination is not lost
On idle wishes and vain fantasy
I did not wish to toss her aside
Like some child full of pride
And spoiled self imagery, but
Yet I play these games full of illusions
And quick imagery such as the mortal mind darenot conceive in thought
Or dream the imagery of angels combating in hell to free the souls
Of mortal man, doth quicken my pulse some to extreme adjuration.
Oh what do I do Iam lost without words and thoughts?
But fear has a grip on my soul as death with her icy fingers
On all of us as we venture forth into the depth of hell
Who will come out victorious and slay the monster of nights and days
And release my muse and her wildly quirky ways.

The Probe
A new, unfamiliar sky greets me
As I leave the nexus
Abandoning the bright, protective shelter
And the companionship of my peers,
I pierce the gloom of unknown dangers
Devouring darkness with ferocious zeal
I clear a path for those who follow.
For Aiur I create:
First the matrix then the base
Surround it with cannons
The foundation is set.
Who would imagine
What one left alone can accomplish?
I am a creator, a gatherer, a seeker, a destroyer
I can do nothing or everything
And some may never know of it
Though my work is on display;
Still, a mere peon that I am,
I am content, knowing that I have created
A masterpiece.

Sky rainbows towering monuments of color
arcing overhead,
A humble tribute to a wrath of clouds;
Like the swirling patterns on polished wood
Whose unseen energy fires the fury of my spells,
Beneath the town where darkness reigns;
Like the heart-born thrill from a battle well fought
Amidst friends who move in sync:
A marvelous ballet of instinct and innovation;
Serves to remind us that the things we cannot own
Are the things we keep the longest.

Master Zen vs. }ArchXAngel{
--- Round 1
*ding*
After trying to run the server at both my castle and his, with
little success ping-wise...both participants agreed to a common server. Netplex was to
be the battleground. Averaging a 250 ping, borderline acceptable thanx to Ver. 3.15, the
combatants dropped onto the field. With 14 murderous fools already hyped for battle, there
was little time to waste. Before me lay the Super-Shotgun...}AXA{'s preferred weapon of
choice. I scooped it up and started the rampage. Zen had already wasted 4 of the dogs by
the time I got my first shot. Taking it...blood splattered and my foe flew feet up onto
his back. Close range super-shotgun is unstoppable.
I crept around the corners, sliding to and fro in search of the
next victim. I found her weakly blasting in the distance. I broke into a trot, leaping
directly into her line of fire...I wasted her like she deserved, then, turning in my
crouch, I tore into her intended with ease...shrill screaming as the buckshot tore him
open. I had found the zone...now we fight. Taking a glance at the stats, Master Zen was
hot. He was dropping them like flies, easily outgunning me - his frag count rose.
Everywhere lay the carnage of the dead. Many a time did I take attacks and even hit the
floor on several occassion...but to no avail - I could not be contained. Slowly I gained
on the Master. Our paths may have crossed twice or three times...maybe more. Too much
action to read who was dying - there were more to be killed. Time was running out. Zen
still led. I happened across a rocket launcher - then the elusive Quad! - grabbing them I
unleashed the fury of an Angel gone mad.
I lept off of my perch into a room crazed with blaster fire.
First one, then another fell under by relentless onslaught. I kept pumping my rockets till
all laid slain at my feet. Wiping the blood from my eyes, I waded throught the twisted
bodies to find a health-pack...God knows I needed it. No luck, the time-limit had been
hit. Looking with suprise at the scores....I had outgunned the Master 25 to 24 kills.
Truly the best fight of my career as a hunter. I look forward to our next savage
encounter, almighty Master Zen.

Night Below
Chapter 1
"It's me, War," said a quiet voice. I recognised it immediately. It was
Aahzmadius, the second most powerful Sorceror I know, and definitely the one I respect
most. I guess part of the reason I respect him so much is that I can't understand half of
what he says when he really gets worked up. I know it's stereotypical, but us Warriors, we
like things simple. How am I supposed to know all these ten- and twelve-letter words he's
always spouting? He must know a lot of stuff if he knows those kinds of words.
"Oh, high, Aahz," I said. I wondered what had brought him out to the middle
of town. He was usually fairly reclusive; I don't think I had ever seen him out and about
in the town proper. "What brings you out among us laypeople?" I asked, almost
half in jest.
"I was on my way to Adria's hut, and I noticed you seemed a bit depressed. Want to
talk about it?" He seemed worried. I pride myself on being tough, but this touched
me.
"Nah, I'm just feeling my age. I'll be fine."
"Nah, I'll only be here a little while longer, then I have to take care of some
things in Real Life." Now I was really confused. This was life, and it was real. I
shrugged mental shoulders. Sorcerors will be Sorcerors.
"OK, and thanks for the support, Aahz." I gave him a weak smile to show I was
fine.
"No prob. Hasta," he said, then he was gone.
Chapter 2
"Today I killed a chicken-"
"...man, are those ghouls tough..."
"On Great Lakes today Yew totally lagged-"
"-I even managed to tame a-"
"Hey, you! Whaddaya think you're doin', pushin' me?" He asked as he gave me a
shove. He stepped forward, apparently not noticing the sizable sword I had sheathed at my
hip. I gave him a tight smile, and then turned away; that's when his hand shot out and
grabbed me by the shoulder. "Hey, we don' like yellow-bellied cowards here, do we
boys?" the guy said. His cohorts chortled at this new turn of events. His hand began
to tighten.
"Just protecting your interests. I can imagine how hard it must be to get wood
around here." Ogden just gave me a wan smile. Saluting him with the mug, I turned
around.
"Hey, War, how've ya been?"
"Long time no see, War!"
"Hello agian Suv... Er, War."
"It's a memory crystal! They can be used to store memories or scenes for playback
later on!" Sprite_II said. "Where did you..." His voice trailed off as he
noticed that I didn't share his excitement.
"Then watch this," I said. I leaned over the crystal, gazed deep into it,
cleared my throat, and growled, "HaSta yIcha'!" A light appeared within the
crystal, and seemed to begin spinning, although the crystal itself was still. Then the
light expanded upward, into the air above the crystal, and a scene began to form.
Chapter 3
"I always liked long odds," Boots said, "but waitaminute. What do you
mean by 'for whoever accompanies me'? We're all coming!"
"What do u mean, war? The stairs are more than wide enough for all of us!"
That last by DarkSniper, with a smile.
"Sure, War!" Said Sprite, "And, uh, I'll try to lay off the Fireballs,
OK?"
"It's got to be done." I found myself admiring his resolve. Sometimes
ignorance _can_ be bliss.
"And you, Boots, wanna make it an even four?"
"War, we _will_ find a way to follow you." And I could see it. I could see in
his eyes the knowledge that both he and I shared: I was leading three of my friends to
their deaths.

<p>Every once in a while, something comes along to debunk your strongly held opinions. For instance, I have believed, and said as much, that <a href=)
Then I happened to interview sporting clays shooter Johnny Meitzen about changing chokes and he said “Everything close I shoot with Briley Diffusion chokes.” He raved about them, then asked “What kind of gun do you shoot? I’ll have them send you some.” I figured he was just taking care of one of his sponsors, but I thought they’d be worth a try, so I said, “Citori with Invector Plus, and thank you very much.”
A few days later a box from Briley showed up. The Diffusion chokes are gently rifled, the idea being to spin the wad and disperse shot more quickly, giving you a quick-opening pattern for close range targets. It’s similar to the Paradox guns of the British Empire, which were rifled at the muzzle so they could shoot either a bullet or shot. Fabarm used to make an O/U with fixed rifled chokes specifically for European woodcock hunters and, for the extremely well-heeled, Holland & Holland makes a few paradox guns today. Incidentally, Briley also made (or maybe still makes) straight-rifled turkey chokes that were supposed to stabilize the wad for tighter patterns. Whether they stabilized wads or not I don’t know, but they sure worked well. But I digress.
Rather than patterning the new chokes first, I took them straight to the skeet field. Targets broke solidly, and I couldn’t miss. When I switched to regular chokes, I could miss again. When the Diffusions went back in the gun, my scores went up again. It’s been that way all summer. As Mars Blackmon insisted in those ancient Air Jordan ads: “It’s gotta be the shoes.”
Having shot these chokes so well, I am now reluctant to pattern them, because why ask why? What if it shoots a patchy pattern that wrecks my confidence? I will, at some point put these on paper. I will definitely pattern them before I ever take them into the field, because gamebirds deserve no less. They might be just the thing for close cover bird hunting. In the meantime, I’m going to keep breaking targets with them, at the same time as I shatter my own long-held opinions. They sell for $84.95 apiece in 12 gauge only.

Avalon Peninsulaby Erin Martin, PassPorter Guest Contributor
Last modified 08-05-2010
It's been said that Newfoundland Canada is as close to heaven as you can get here on earth. Whether you agree or not, this island's natural beauty will certainly leave you breathless. Located on the eastern coast of Canada, and just a four hour plane ride from New York, Newfoundland is a whole new world for the senses.
Newfoundland Canada
View from Signal Hill overlooking the city of St. John's
Since there is so much land to cover in one trip, the focus of our visit was the Avalon Peninsula. This area to the far east of the island is home to half of the entire population of Newfoundland. As is the case for most of Newfoundland, nature is the highlight. Everywhere you look are vast expanses of untouched land filled with trees, mountains, and cliffs. Be on the lookout for wildlife as well, even where you least expect it. The locals will tell you that the biggest danger on the highway here is not crazy drivers, but moose! If you are driving, be mindful that they can appear anywhere, even on the Trans-Canada Highway.
Although, you can attempt to see wildlife anywhere, Newfoundland has created wildlife reserves for those who want to focus on seeing animals. We chose to take a tour of the Cape St. Mary’s Ecological Reserve located on the Cape Shore. After a drive to this coastal point, we walked out to the edge of the cliffs to find over 350 species of birds everywhere. These birds are in their natural environment and are free to come and go as they please. The reserve is so much a part of nature that you can walk right over a cliff if you’re not careful! Neither you nor the birds are contained, but the end result is a place where people and birds can meet naturally. If the birds don’t amaze you, then the view of the cliffs and ocean certainly will. While this was the only reserve we visited, there are others. Boat tours are also popular here and can take you out to see the native wildlife, which includes whales and puffins.
Even though nature lovers will be at home in Newfoundland, rest assured that those with a passion for history will not be far behind. History buffs will love a stop at Signal Hill National Historic Site, located in St. John’s Newfoundland. Signal Hill is where Marconi received the first transatlantic radio signal in 1901 and it also provided harbor defenses for the city from the 18th century up until World War II. The drive up this steep and windy hill takes you first to the Visitor’s Center where tours can be had for a fee. Also located directly outside the Visitor’s Center is the area where the Signal Hill Tattoo performs 19th century military drills. We unfortunately missed the last drill of the day, so we headed further up the hill to see the fortifications that remained. You will find remains of the fortresses as well as plenty of cannons for prime photo opportunities. You can also find a fantastic view of the city of St. John’s on one side, and the vast ocean on the other. Even if history doesn’t interest you, the view from Signal Hill is worth the trip. You might even see some wildlife. On our visit, we could actually see a whale shooting water up out of the ocean. It was another amazing moment.
Signal Hill isn’t the only place for history. St. John’s, the capital of Newfoundland, is one of the oldest cities in North America, having had people living in it since the 1620s. Here history meets current culture, with everything from historical churches to Starbucks. Just driving through the city is a tour in itself. This city provides something for everyone and we tried to do a little of everything.
We made a stop at The Rooms, which is a museum/art gallery. The Rooms is housed in a beautiful building, consisting of several floors. Each floor holds different rooms, with different themes from history to art. In one room we learned about the history of Newfoundland and in another room we learned about native animals. We also were able to see local artists’ work as well as more famous paintings and photographs. One of my favorite “rooms” was filled with Newfoundland artifacts with everything from old hand washers to carriages to bikes.
From here we made a quick drive over to the Basilica of St. John the Baptist. This Roman Catholic Church was built in the mid-1850s and is a sight to see. The architecture and stained glass outside as well as the detail inside are worth seeing. Tours are available from June to September, but you can choose to explore the church on your own.
In the heart of St. John’s you can find other entertainment. Shopping can be had on Water Street, with everything from local crafters to kitschy souvenirs. This is the place to shop for all the “Newfoundland” memorabilia you could want! One place you definitely have to stop is the Downhomer. This large store has a whole section of books written about Newfoundland or by Newfoundlanders. There is even a children’s section, which houses some interesting titles. Don’t forget to check upstairs, where you can buy a variety of prints of photographs and paintings done by locals.

Once the shopping is done we headed a block over to world-famous George Street. This street is said to have the most bars per square foot in North America. Whether that’s true or not, there are quite a few crammed into the street. The street only allows foot traffic and people stumble from one bar to the next. We visited on a Friday night and found quite a few of the bars to have live entertainment. We enjoyed a few beers and a local guitarist/singer at Greensleeves Pub. We then made our way to Trapper John’s to be “screeched in.”
To truly be one of the locals, all visitors to this island need to partake in this ritual. It involves taking a shot of screech (which is a strong Jamaican rum sold in Newfoundland) and then kissing a cod fish on the lips. At Trapper John’s you take the shot, but kiss the bottom of a stuffed penguin. After that they give you a certificate stating that you have been officially “screeched in.” It sounds strange, but it’s certainly a lot of fun and not to be missed on your trip!
Being “screeched in” on George Street was the last hurrah to a fabulous trip. Our week spent seeing the sights was a whirlwind of activity and there was really much more to see and do. If you ever have the chance to venture that far north, definitely make a stop in Newfoundland. No matter what part of the island you visit, you certainly won’t regret it!

>>IMAGEProfessor Michael E. Porter shared his ideas about the role of competitiveness and clusters for countries and companies and congratulated all the participating companies during his address to the hugely interactive group of best of corporate in India. He shared his thoughts regarding how tremendous opportunity exists in India to make a leap on competitiveness.
He further added that India needs to focus on understanding and practicing clusters based approach. It would enable the country to gain competitive advantage at country, state and company levels. The main determinants of competitiveness are microeconomic and macroeconomic factors.
The microeconomic factors include quality of business environment, state of cluster development, and sophistication of company operations and strategy. The macroeconomic factors include monetary/ fiscal policies and human development for effective public institutions. He discussed changing landscape of India and signs of moving ahead beyond bureaucracy and inefficiency. He gave the following recommendations.
First, India needs to focus on competitiveness and not jobs per se. Second, focus on clusters based development where companies create a synergy effect. Third, India being a complex economy should adopt bottom-up approach rather than top-down for enhancing competitiveness.

Larin,M. Blood 1995, 85:3093100. 1169 ReplicationWithinandBetweenSites. Vasc.That the the new york stock exchange automated trading system is called Acquired immuneIt is called a dawn patrol. Every morning in Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince, journalists slowly search the garbage heaps along National Highway 1 between the harbour and the airport for fresh bodies. They are rarely disappointed. An A.P. photographer tells how he found a young man the day before, throat cut, left at this busy roadside all day in the hot sun as a stark warning against anti-government words or actions.
Bodies that are unclaimed are eventually taken to Ti Tanyen, a paupers grave just north of the capital which has come to accommodate hundreds of unknown victims of violent death-a place few Haitians dare go, or even know the exact location of. It is not by coincidence that this stretch of road passes through Cite Soleil, the suburb where the capital's most destitute live, and where democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has his greatest support.
In 1990 Aristide received 67% of the popular vote in the first and only truly free election in Haiti's history. Nine months later, on September 30, 1991, he was overthrown in a military coup, having angered key elements of the armed forces and business elites by refusing to share power with them.
Since then, the poor have become the targets of paramilitary death squads, commonly referred to as Attaches or FRAP (Front for the Advancement and Progress) of Haiti. These military forces are little more than the remnants of the dreaded Tontons Macoutes security forces that terrorized the opponents of the dictatorial Duvalier family. Led initially by President Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier from 1957 to 1971, they held supreme authority until the military overthrow of Papa Doc's son, Jean-Claude Duvalier, in 1986.
Today, with a population outnumbering Haiti's tiny military force 1000 to 1, terror is still the most effective weapon of the elite. Eschewing the tactic of open mass slaughter, Haiti's military leaders have learned that to control domestic unrest, and at the same time minimize the chance of foreign intervention, one merely has to surgically eliminate key Aristide supporters.
Visiting Ti Tanyen is a task in itself. At Port-au-Prince's Holiday Inn, a popular meeting spot for journalists, one of the many Haitian men who try to peddle their services as guides warns that "it is not safe to go because the Attaches often are there, and might shoot any unwanted trespassers." Many of these "guides" are generally believed to be informers for the military regime, paid to keep an eye on the press and to dissuade them from going to sensitive areas. The advice is therefore ignored.
Since no one except those in the immediate vicinity really knows where the grave-yard is, it is best to take a taxi, as the driver is able to stop frequently and ask directions. Before setting out, however, the current U.N. arms and oil embargo makes it necessary to go to a very discreet black market gas station at 70 Rue des Cesars in the crowded market district. At the curbside, a man pumps gas from a barrel into gallon jugs while, nearby, another with a shotgun looks on. The driver buys only one gallon, but pays an unbelievable price of U.S. $9.00 Prior to sanctions, gas was only U.S. $1.00per gallon.
As laid out by the United Nations-brokered Governor's Island Accord of July 3, 1993, Aristide was to have returned to Haiti the following October 30. When the country's military leader, General Raoul Cedras, reneged on the agreement in early October, the U.N. moved quickly to establish a naval blockade of Haiti's main harbor in Port-au-Prince. On any given day U.S. and other warships can be seen patrolling offshore.
Coupled with these sanctions, the collapse of order after the fall of Duvalier has rendered the capital literally a sewer. There are no government services to clean up the mountainous piles of garbage that block many of the key intersections, and it is commonplace to see people bathing in the gutters. At night, the frequent power outages hide a deserted city-silent, except for the sound of periodic gunfire.
Although it is only a 45 minute drive north to Ti Tanyen, it is easy to miss. Viewed from this empty stretch of highway, all one sees is low scrubland extending west for a mile to the serene and picturesque Golfe de la Gonave. Jean-FranCois, the care-taker of the site, points to the narrow dirt road entering the area and explains that this is where the Attaches regularly drive in to drop off bodies in the middle of the night.
A short walk quickly reveals countless small hills and mounds; one sees the ground littered with human bones, skulls, and shreds of clothing. "I buried these six this morning," Jean-FranCois says as he points to six fresh plots. In fact, so crowded is Ti Tanyen that it is difficult to walk anywhere without stepping on (or tripping over) a grave or some poor soul's skeletal remains.
The U.N. and the U.S. have pulled out of Haiti, afraid of another Somalia fiasco. Moreover neither can decide what future course of action is best. In Washington, the administration is split between a pro-Aristide president and an anti-Aristide CIA; and without American leadership, the U.N. is impotent. Caught between a brutal regime on the one hand and an indecisive world body on the other, Haitians see little hope for a return to democracy.
The taxi driver is visibly uneasy, anxious to return to the city. Before leaving Ti Tanyen, however, Jean-FranCois has one more thing he wants to show us. Demonstrating how commonplace death has become in Haiti, he deftly uses his machete to scoop up a skull through the bullet hole in the back-and poses for the camera.
J Taylor Wentges was in Haiti from October 27 to November 10 1993. He is doing research for a PhD thesis to begin in September 1994.

The town has been deprived of a tree for two years after Wigan Council could not afford to stump up the cash.
A tree would usually be placed on the town hall, but wind destroyed the mount and budget cuts means it has gone unrepaired.
Disappointed residents launched an online crowdfunding campaign after hundreds of people complained they would like to see a tree again.
Stewart McGarrie, who runs the Old Leigh Photographs heritage group on Facebook, organised the campaign.
Within three weeks £5,000 was raised to cover the cost of tree, with a number of activities taking place across the town centre also helping raise more cash.
The 25ft tree has been placed outside Leigh Town Hall decorated in 4,000 red and white LED lights to represent the town colours.
It is the first real Christmas tree to be displayed in Leigh for more than a decade.
A festive light switch-on ceremony took place in the town centre on Monday evening, with Stewart’s 79-year-old mother Patricia McGarrie being given the honour of flicking on the lights.
There were also performances from school choirs, an adult choir, a brass band and local dance troupes.
Stewart, 52, said: “Everybody said I should do the light-switch on, but then I had a small problem.
“My mum asked if she could do it and I couldn’t say no. She is absolutely over the moon, she can’t believe her son has organised it and she gets to turn the lights on.”
He added: “We have not had a real Christmas tree for over a decade. People have said it is beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
“When I’m walking down the street people keep stopping me and saying how good it is.
“Everybody is delighted, everybody is so excited.”
Stewart’s mother worked as a district midwife in the area for many years and has delivered hundreds of babies in the area.
Wigan Council have worked alongside the fundraisers to provide electricity as well as health and safety guidance.
Councillor Myra Whiteside, chairman of the Leigh Town Centre Committee, said: “We wish the campaign well. A new tree for Leigh will complement the town centre’s Christmas lights.
“The town centre committee will offer advice to the campaign where appropriate.”
Leigh’s Christmas lights are funded jointly by Wigan Council and the Leigh south, east and west and Atherleigh ward councillors through their Brighter Borough funding. Annually the Christmas lights cost £32,000.This exercise for sciatica may be helpful in the early stages. Stand up and arch your back over your hands. Don’t push too far at first – build up gradually.
This sciatic nerve exercise should not worsen your pain. In particular it should not worsen any leg pain, numbness or tingling you may have. Successful exercises for sciatica should gradually reduce the symptoms in your legs.
If you find that your sciatica symptoms are worsening then stop the exercises immediately and seek some more help.
Not all sciatic nerve exercises are suitable for all people with back pain - you need to get the right ones for you - discuss with your doctor.

A statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Yinka Oyebode, said the minister would not be distracted by the allegations raised against him by the Ekiti State House of Assembly.
According to him, the allegations are baseless and calculated to distract him, “a rehash of old tales told by little minds.”
Mr. Oyebode said since the allegations lacked substance, it was bound to fail like the previous ones by the state government and its agents.
“The petition by the Assembly is nothing but another calculated attempt to distract and tarnish the hard earned reputation of the honourable minister with spurious allegations,” the statement read.

He advised the Fayose-led government to concentrate on the provision of amenities in the state and desist from its “maniacal penchant” for falsehood and cheap blackmail.A well-organized, well-stocked IKEA kitchen pantry can make the kitchen and the pursuit of different ingredients easier.

HON. RANIL WICKRAMASINGHE, PRIME MINISTER,
HON. MANGALA SAMARAWEERA, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS,
HON R. SAMPANTHAN, LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,
PRINCE ZEID BIN RA’AD, UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.
Your Excellency and Honourable Sirs,
SRI LANKAN UNIVERSITY ACADEMICS APPEAL TO THE AUTHORITIES REGARDING THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL RESOLUTION ON SRI LANKA
One of the greatest challenges facing the new government today is that of reconciliation between ethnic and religious communities. This challenge is all the more formidable because ever since the end of the war in 2009 in Sri Lanka, the ideology of the ruling regime reinforced ideas of Sinhala majoritarian supremacy and the suppression of minorities. It is in this context that we need to respond to the recent UN Human Rights Council Report on Sri Lanka and the resolution to which the current government is a co-sponsor.
We, the undersigned, took different positions during the war fought between the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE. Some of us were opposed to the war, while some of us were of the view that the LTTE had to be defeated militarily. However, whatever our differences on the war, we are of the view that the conduct of the Sri Lankan state after the end of the war and the military defeat of the LTTE in 2009 exacerbated existing ethnic tensions in the country. No war can claim to have been fought cleanly. All wars claim victims and leave losers. The latest UNHRC report documents with strong evidence the human rights violations that occurred during the last stages of the war. Even otherwise, our own observations and experiences provide evidence of the tremendous losses, suffering and trauma to which our fellow citizens, especially in the North and East were subject. The efforts especially by the last regime, to gloss over these losses have been the greatest barrier to national reconciliation. It created a situation where any attempt to acknowledge the loss and trauma of war and violence were depicted as ‘anti-national’, pro-terrorist and unpatriotic. It is time that these notions are once and for all put to rest. The Sri Lankan state which has claimed victory in this war, a war which we must remember was fought against its own citizens and was the result of historical failures in state-building, has an undeniable responsibility to respond to these instances of human rights violations.
We are strongly of the view that it is therefore necessary to acknowledge the loss, suffering and trauma of this war. People who were subjected to human rights violations deserve to have their story heard and acknowledged. It is also noteworthy that this report documents human rights violations also in the South of the country. The grief and loss of those whose rights have been violated cannot simply be ignored or swept aside through the rhetoric of ‘defeating terrorism’ and ‘protecting the sovereignty of the country’. Attempts by certain groups, individuals and the media to portray this report as ‘anti Sri Lanka’ are particularly disturbing since it suggests that some Sri Lankan citizens are less worthy or more expendable than others. It is for this reason that we strongly oppose attempts to undermine investigations into human rights violations during the war and to hold accountable those who were responsible for such violations. We find attempts to frame such interventions as ‘western conspiracies’, attacks on sovereignty and insulting to ‘war heroes’ as particularly damaging towards reconciliation and healing. We would like to draw the attention of everyone, especially those who are resisting current efforts to investigate human rights violations, to Sri Lanka’s international obligations to uphold human rights of all its citizens.
We therefore call upon the Sri Lankan government, all political parties, the UN and other international bodies and sponsors of the UNHRC resolution to place the needs and concerns of those who suffered during the war at the forefront of any mechanisms that will be put in place in the future. This relates not only to their protection, but also that their psychosocial needs and wellbeing should drive the investigation and accountability process. We must also ensure those who have suffered human rights violations do not get ‘re-traumatised’ through this endeavour and that psychosocial support for those who need it is provided before, during and after the process. In this regard we emphasize that what is required is not simply a judicial process or a punitive process of investigation and punishment, but a process that will consider and respond to all the different needs of those who have been affected by the war such as their material, emotional and social protection needs. This means approaching the issue of justice from the broadest possible perspective. We strongly urge all parties involved to desist from efforts to use the suffering and trauma of these people for engaging in political grandstanding. We also urge the Sri Lankan state and the UN to ensure that the process of accountability is made meaningful for the victims of war and not simply as an exercise in image building for any individual, group or organisation.
It is in this context, that we are especially concerned that the process for investigation and accountability that is undertaken is independent and legitimate. Given the serious erosion of judicial independence in Sri Lanka in recent times, we are of the opinion that a purely domestic process cannot ensure justice or inspire confidence especially among the affected people. Neither do we think that the mere presence of international actors can ensure this. We call upon all those responsible to learn from similar processes in countries such as South Africa and Cambodia and to apply those lessons to the processes and institutions that are to be established in Sri Lanka.
We, the undersigned, reiterate that how we deal with the human rights violations during the wars could be the single most meaningful intervention towards the all important and badly needed task of reconciliation, healing and rebuilding our country as one which is truly democratic, inclusive and pluralistic. Without acknowledging our past wrongdoing we will be unable to move forward as a country and society.

Wait, wait and wait some more.
Lee Pulliam had already done that three times before, but on Sept. 21, 2017, the Semora, North Carolina, native found himself waiting for an important phone call once again.
After many long hours of waiting, Pulliam got the call from NASCAR that he had been crowned the 2017 NASCAR Whelen All-American Seires national champion. He won the championship by a mere three points over Trevor Huddleston.
“There is no I in team, so we couldn’t have done it without some really important people,” Pulliam said. “It was stressful and pretty nerve-wracking this year, because you are basically talking about one or two cars on the race track.”
The title allowed Pulliam to tie Philip Morris for the second most national titles all-time, with four. All of Pulliam’s national titles have come in the last five years, with the first coming in 2012. He also won in 2013 and 2015 and he finished second in 2014.
“Every year is a little bit different, but I want to be successful, so the stress level is there no matter what,” Pulliam said of his 2017 title run. “The experience (from past titles) has allowed me to stay calm and cool on the track and know that I need to perform. During the week, I get a little stressed out looking at it.”
In the last seven years, Pulliam has finished inside the top five in the national standings each year. Morris, Anthony Anders and Matt Bowling were the only other three drivers to win the title in that stretch. He still trails the late Larry Phillips, who won five times in his career.
From 2011 to ’17, Pulliam has 155 wins in 290 starts. He has 161 career NASCAR Late Model wins since 2008, when he made his first and only start of that season.
“I want to make as big of an impact as I can on this series and on this level,” Pulliam said. “I just want to see how far I can go. It’s awesome to think about and talk about, but at the same time you have to just keep grinding if you want to keep winning. I can’t worry about the stats a whole lot. We are just focused on winning the next one.”
In 45 starts across eight different tracks, Pulliam was victorious 19 times this year. The stretch also included 36 top fives and 43 top 10s, allowing him to defeat Huddleston, but only by just those three points. Huddleston only competed at three tracks, but won 22 of his 35 starts between Irwindale, Kern County and Tucson.
Pulliam competed across three different states and eight different tracks, running races at North Carolina’s Southern National Raceway Park, Hickory Motor Speedway and Caraway Speedway. In South Carolina, he won the track championship at Myrtle Beach Speedway and also competed at Anderson Speedway. In Virginia, Pulliam ran at Dominion Raceway, Motor Mile Speedway and South Boston Speedway. All eight tracks allowed him to pick up crucial points he needed to become national champion for a record fourth time.
However, although he ran races across those eight circuits, Pulliam frequently visited the winner’s circle at Myrtle Beach in 2017. In 17 starts on the 0.538-mile oval, he won 14 times as part of the Late Model class. He started with a victory in the Icebreaker in February and finished it off with a win on the final points night, September 9. However, his plan at the outset of the season didn’t even include many races there.
“We really hadn’t even planned to run there full-time, because it’s somewhere I didn’t have a lot of experience,” Pulliam said. “But we decided to make the haul down there. It’s five and half hours and it really took a lot of effort from the team. Everyone put a lot of effort into going that extra mile to be able to race down there. We went to the Icebreaker, the car count was great and we kind of looked at it as the perfect place to run a full season — because the car count is so important to winning this title.”
The 29-year-old who now calls Alton, Virginia home, says that victory in the Icebreaker at Myrtle Beach really set the tone for him to be able to make the championship run.
“The way we set the tone at the Icebreaker, we went out and were pretty dominant and it just set that tone to keep going there for the rest of the year,” Pulliam said. “If we would have went there and run fifth, we probably wouldn’t have gone their full-time.”
Although the season started with a few victories, Pulliam did have a stretch where he wasn’t successful on the track, because of some bad luck. However, in order to win the title, he had to keep pushing.
“We started off the year hot out of the box and won quite a few races, then we had a lull, and I started checking the points out and I saw Trevor was about seventh or eighth, but I saw how many races he had started,” Pulliam said. “I told my guys that he was going to be one of the guys we were going to have to beat if we wanted to win. I had no idea it was going to be so close come down the end. We were able to get rid of some of the bad luck and start winning races again and that was the difference.”
At the start of the season, Pulliam wasn’t even sure what he was going to do in order to chase the trophy.
“Every year I just leave it open because I found that every year takes something different to win,” Pulliam said. “I just try to go where I feel like my momentum is, and it ended up being Myrtle Beach this year. We weren’t really sure where we were going to go, but we wanted to do what we performed the best at. We didn’t really have a plan.”
All championships are important in any sport, but this season, Pulliam’s title hit close to home. He was able to celebrate with his family, especially his wife and newest daughter Brantley. The support from his family has been something that allowed him to have the drive to win. He told his wife that he was going to put everything he could towards winning a fourth national title, and in the end, he accomplished his goal.
“Two years ago, I stood on this stage just two weeks after my wife was involved in an accident that broke her femur,” Pulliam said. “At the hospital, we learned that she was pregnant, and today, we have the most beautiful 16-month-old girl. I was able to share it with my family this year. I became a dad in 2016 and it changes a lot of things and it makes racing a little bit tougher because you have an added responsibility, but there is nothing I enjoy more than being a dad. Trying to balance time with the family, with having fast race cars and racing every week, it was more mentally tough than any of the other titles. I wanted to be able to take a photo with my girl and the big trophy. It was a little bit of extra motivation.”
For now, Pulliam is soaking up the glory of being champion for the fourth time.
“It’s a blessing to have such a good car owner and team, we worked so many hours this year,” Pulliam said. “My guys went above and beyond and never gave up. It would have been easy to go home or go to bed early, but they didn’t do that. We missed a lot of dinners and we missed a lot of events this year to make this happen. It gives you goosebumps thinking about number five, I’m not sure this is the year because I’m busy with my family, but I would love to do it. It takes a lot out of you when you go racing. There has to be a balance.”

As you can imagine, I have been a little busy. Wednesday May 4, 2011 we welcomed our 6th child. We are so blessed. Thank you all for your prayers. He is a beautiful baby boy and his little lungs are quite healthy (should put a video on here of him crying). He is a little jaundiced, but that is mild.
I love him!
I love him too!!! He is sooooooo precious!tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1021668448931262073.post4644053180886695073..comments2018-01-08T18:47:46.956-10:00Comments on Pics and Kicks: we'll be washing our hands. a lot.Natalie.

It is a rare exception that a New Year’s Resolution involves our ultimate and final goal of this life – eternal happiness with the Lord in the next. Don’t get me wrong – I am not suggesting that you cease making the “losing, quitting, saving” resolutions – just that you consider adding a resolution or two that will impact your life for all eternity. Here are 7 Catholic resolutions for the New Year to consider: 1. Go to Daily Mass one extra day per week. The Catechism of the Catholic Church, quoting Lumen Gentium, describes the Eucharist as “the source and suumit of the Christian life” and states that “the Church strongly encourages the faithful to receive the holy Eucharist on Sundays and feast days, or more often still, even daily.” If you are not already a Daily Mass attendee, resolve to attend just one more Mass each week.2. Add a new prayer to your prayer routine. For me, this year, I am planning to embrace the discipline of doing Morning prayer and Evening prayer from the Liturgy of the Hours each day. However, there are so many ways of incorporating more prayer in your life: Daily Mass, the Rosary, the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, the Noon-time Angelus- the list is endless. Make a commitment today that will be achievable – even if the only commitment you are able to make is to pray one single Our Father each day.3. Read the Saints 365 BlogEagle Protection Service

“With the economy continuing to grow slowly, it is not surprising that salary increases have followed suit,” said Jeff Blair, Hay Group’s U.S. Productized Services Leader. “Relatively low annual salary increase budgets are limiting the financial rewards available to employers. As a result, organizations are increasingly focused on improving employee engagement and creating a positive work climate for employees.”
“Sectors with increases above the general industry median often have more optimistic business performance outlooks,” said Tom McMullen, Hay Group’s North American Reward Practice Leader. “Some sectors rebounded more quickly and have higher margins than other industries, which may explain why projected base salary increases are higher. Moreover, in most industries we see organizations seeking to remain competitive by placing greater emphasis on variable pay programs, career development opportunities, meaningful job designs and non.”At different times throughout the year, Redeemer Lutheran Green Bay holds a rummage sale.

New Delhi, Aug 12 (IANS) ‘Ind ‘think.for United States carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, US Cellular, and Sprint. This will be good news for HTC One M9 owners, and even more good news as there is a sales at HTC for today only.
There is good news for users of the HTC One M9 as the flagship phone as the unlocked model, its developer edition, as well as the version that AT&T is offering is receiving the Android 5.1 offering today, according to Ubergizmo. If you have the M9 with another carrier, such as T-Mobile, you might have to do some possible waiting. By the way, this over-the-Air (OTA) update is pretty memory heavy at 833 MB, so you should probably do this update over Wi-Fi when you get the chance..
On a somewhat related note, it would appear that HTC is offering very large deals on its accessories. Right now, you get the Nexus 9 8.9 inch tablet at 40 percent off, the RE Camera (a small handheld camera that works as its own standalone device) for 50 percent off, and the aforementioned HTC One M9 at 25 percent off.
So if you want an excuse to upgrade to the HTC One M9, than HTC just gave you a good excuse on a silver platter. The sale at HTC can be accessed using those links above, and it ends at 11:59 PM PDT on July 28, 2015 and is only valid in the United States. So, yes, you are going to have to hurry.Wayt, McComas win at Top Gun
Beaver Local’s Beau Smith grapples with Ravenna's Jeff Dunfee during a 145-pound matchon Saturday at the Alliance Top Gun Tournament.
ALLIANCE — Beaver Local and West Branch, two wrestling schools steeped in mat tradition, had one individual champion each to lead the area at the prestigious 46-team Top Gun Wrestling Tournament finals held in Alliance’s Harry Fails Gymnasium Saturday night.
The Beavers finished in 15th place with 82 points and had three placewinners, led by champion Cole McComas (22-2) at 113 pounds.
Meanwhile, West Branch finished 11th overall with 113.5 points and the Warriors saw four wrestlers place, paced by 120-pound junior Christian Wayt who successfully repeated as a Top Gun champion.
Minerva finished 17th in the tournament with 71 points and had an individual Top Gun runner-up in Travis Kuttler at 285 pounds.
Akron St. Vincent St. Mary won this year’s Top Gun team title with 182 points, outdistancing second-place Austintown Fitch which finished with 152 points.
Beaver Local’s McComas captured his Top Gun championship while holding off Olentangy’s Jacob Sherman, 3-2 in an outstanding, low-scoring bout.
“It’s really good competition here,” said McComas. “I felt pretty good (in his title match), I was just kind of keeping my head and hands low and making sure he (Sherman) didn’t get any good shots on me.”
Beaver Local head coach Jordan Williams praised the talented McComas.
“Cole is just a very smart, technique-driven wrestler,” praised Williams. “He’s solid in all positions and hard to score on.”
McComas, who finished second at the state meet as a freshman last year, is setting his goal to win it all this season.
“I’m ranked about second or third right now (in the state),” explained the Beaver Local standout. “Yeah, (winning it all is the goal).”
Other placewinners for the Beavers included Skyler Lasure (third, 132) and Beau Smith (eighth, 145).
“Our kids came here to get competition and we found a lot of great competition,” said Williams. “I’m happy with the way our kids competed. Every week we’re just looking for the opportunity to wrestle good kids and get better and I think we took advantage of that.”
West Branch’s Christian Wayt, ranked No. 1 in the state, defeated Isaac Crowell from Fort Leboeuf (Pa.), 13-6 at 120 pounds. Tied 3-3, Wayt hit Crowell with a five-point move and also received penalty
points to go up 11-3 in the second period and went on to the 13-6 win.
“He (Crowell) was a state placer in Pennsylvania (last year) so it’s a good win,” said Wayt. “I felt pretty confident (after going up 11-3) because I don’t usually get scored on a lot, so I figured it would be hard for him to score eight points and come back.”
Wayt is now 26-0 on the season.
“That (winning the state title this year) is definitely the goal,” added Wayt.
West Branch head coach Chris Dorris said Wayt had another great tournament and finals match.
“What Christian did well is what he always does well, he’s a very good wrestler, a technical wrestler and he goes into the match knowing exactly what he wants to do, and we saw that time and time again during this tournament,” said the West Branch coach.
“That kid (Crowell) got a little physical with Christian and Christian didn’t back down, he strapped it up and said, let’s go boy,” added Dorris.
The Warriors’ other placewinners included Dylan Miller (fifth at 152), Peter Biery (eighth, 160) and Neil Ginnetti (seventh, 170).
Minerva’s Travis Kuttler was the Lions’ lone placewinner, finishing as a Top Gun runner-up after a loss by pin in 1:36 to Girard’s highly-ranked Jack Delgarbino.
“We had eight guys come back on Day 2 here and had four guys get to the placement round and lost tough matches,” said Minerva head coach Chad Hilliard said. “and it was nice getting Travis Kuttler back in the finals again and he beat (Leasure of Alliance) along the way who was a state placer last year. Travis won some quality matches along the way to get to the finals.”

Here’s a possible workaround.
If you’re trying to install software on your Mac the first thing you should do is simply contact your IT department. They can use login to your computer remotely and installed the software for you. You may not like having to wait for IT but it’s not you’re computer so you shouldn’t install stuff on it. Also, you could unwittingly end up installing something that looks benign but is actually nefarious.
That being said, in an emergency there are two possible solutions:
- Drag and Drop
- Single User Mode
When you see the application installation login window you can either beg for the admin password or try a little workaround that I’m about to show you.
First see if you can just drag the app icon into the Applications folder.
If that fails, you could try Control clicking the app and choosing Open Package Details to see if you can modify the info.plist file or whatevever.
There was on old hack that worked on older versions of Mac OS X that let you modify a string in info.plist which effectively disabled authentication. Well I haven’t found a way to get this work in Mac OS X Yosemite so I’m going to assume it doesn’t work anymore.
One other possibility is to boot the Mac to Single User Mode and use the Directory Services Command Line tool to join your non-admin account to the administrator group.
Reboot and hold down Command + s until you see a black screen appear with a bunch of white text.
After a few seconds you’ll at something that resembles a Unix prompt.
First we need to mount the root file system so type
mount -uw /
This mounts the root file system for read-write access.
Then type:
sudo dscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership <usernameToBeGivenRoot>
Replace <usernameToBeGivenRoot> with your non-admin username.
If you need to list the users and groups you can type:
dscl . list /users dscl . list /groups
Press Enter, type reboot and login with your non-admin account.
Ultimately, you shouldn’t try to “hack around” the password security mechanisms that prevent you from installing software. These features are here for a reason and unless you really know what you’re doing some of the tutorials out there can leave you with a broken PC and a chagrined look on your face when you call IT and they ask you what happened.FISHING REPORT 05-08-15

For healing, managing wellness and preserving youth, clean, living water is most important.
In today’s polluted environment we cannot over estimate the importance of the quality of the water we drink. Our bodies are 70-80% water and to keep our cells well hydrated and alkaline we need around 2 litres of pristine clean and living water every day. Good water involves more than just a lack of impurities. There are many water treatment systems on the market today, that promise to remove harmful sediments, minerals and foreign materials from your drinking water. But if the purpose of the water system were only to remove foreign materials, then we might as well be drinking distilled water –pure H2O.
Recently we installed a new system in the clinic that not only purifies water, but takes it to a whole new level due to mineral and volcanic stones, high-field strength magnets and silver stones placed on the floor of the storage tank to inhibit the growth of bacteria, maintain a balanced range of beneficial minerals, and adjust the pH balance to mildly alkaline.
For exceptional bio-availability the water also undergoes an optimizing process due to rapid movement in a vortex (cyclonic) pattern with rotating 3,500 gauss magnets. This process adds oxygen, super magnetizes and reduces the size of clusters of water molecules and changes the molecular structure of the water to a hexagonal shape for rapid absorption into the blood stream.
Next time you come to the clinic, please try our enhanced water system and enjoy the Pi Mag living water with the same qualities as a pristine mountain spring, and enjoy the outstanding health benefits of superior cell hydration and alkalinity.

Enzymes – how important are they?
Enzymes are the specialized protein molecules that are involved in every function of our body. Enzymes are the workforce and life force of the body. People with an enzyme deficiency, are prone to health problems, diseases and disorders. Recent studies have found decreased levels of enzymes in people with chronic diseases such as cancer, immune deficiencies, arthritis, diabetes, allergies, and skin disorders etc.
According to Dr. Edward Howell the source of most health problems can be traced back to improperly digested foods. Undigested food can cause problems in the bloodstream, in the intestines and colon. Our body has the ability to heal itself when given the support it needs. Proper digestion should be a high priority for anyone desiring the best possible health.
Supplementation of the digestive enzymes will improve digestion of raw and cooked food and help clean the blood; this will conserve the body energy for more important functions like protection (immune system) and repairing (metabolic enzymes).
Maybe you experience falling asleep soon after eating a large meal? This means your body just shuts down to conserve the energy towards digesting that big meal. It can take up to 50% or more of the body’s vital energy in the role of digesting and cleaning up the blood.
Cleaning up the blood requires a higher priority than protecting and repairing, because the undigested particles are an immediate danger and can cause problems in the body.
If we supplement with digestive enzymes, the protectors and repairers can go back into the priority mode of guarding and repair. In this mode, vitamins, minerals, fruit and vegetables can be utilized to nourish, protect and repair the body. First we must have proper digestion and clean blood if we want our nutrients to be fully utilized.
Raw food or digestive enzymes – which are better for the body?
Giving our body live digestive enzymes or live food enzymes can help protect and replenish our body’s enzyme supply.
Today’s modern agricultural practices greatly deplete the concentration of live enzymes, vitamins and minerals. Digestive enzymes can help digest raw foods that no longer have as many live enzymes as they did 30 or 50 years ago. When a live food is lacking in vitamins and minerals, the enzymes are not as potent. Digestive enzymes are more concentrated, more potent and more effective than today’s raw food enzymes.
Heartburn and indigestion are often remedied by antacids that bring temporary relief by neutralizing stomach acidity, but stop the body from doing its digestive job, while enzymes help the body to do this job. Supplements with plant digestive enzymes make a lot more sense. They are the safest and most effective, and help heartburn and indigestion immediately.
Halitosis (bad breath) is often an indication of digestive problems. Breath mints or chewing gums only hide the problem, giving temporarily relief. Digestive enzymes taken regularly can help eliminate halitosis.
A foul smelling stool that sinks instead of floating indicates that undigested foods are within it. In the intestinal track and colon undigested proteins putrefy, undigested carbohydrates ferment and undigested fat turns rancid. When the stool has a foul odor, it indicates digestive problems.
Some conditions associated with deficiency of each digestive enzyme:
Amylase (digests carbohydrates): Skin problems – rashes, hives, herpes, and canker sores. Liver and gall bladder diseases
Protease(digests proteins): Kidney problems, water retention, osteoporosis, arthritis, bone spurs, low blood sugar, anxiety, compromised immunity, cancer, bacterial and viral infection and appendicitis.
Lipase (digests fats): High cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, high blood pressure, spastic colon, dizziness and chronic fatigue.
Cellulase (digests fibre): Bloating, gas, acute food allergies, candidiasis (yeast infections), facial pain and facial paralysis
Sucrase (digests sugars): Hyperactivity, mood swings, insomnia, depression, lung problems, asthma, bronchitis, chronic diarrhea, dizziness and seizures.
How can you build a strong healthy body?
Add digestive enzymes to your basic supplements (Minerals, Vitamins and Essential Fatty Acids).
Take your digestive enzymes with food; my favorite way is to open one capsule and sprinkle its contents directly on the food to aid efficient digestion
To cleanse your blood one capsule of digestive enzymes on an empty stomach is required. Cleaner blood makes a healthier person.
Plant-derived colloidal minerals are the only type of minerals that our bodies were made to absorb, providing up to 98% absorption, and because of their unique molecular structure any excess is flushed from the body, leaving no toxic build-up.
People not taking digestive enzymes both with meals and on an empty stomach are ageing faster, because they are using up their own enzyme reserves and more of their body’s vital energy.
Why not start today to keep your body in optimum condition?

Tips for the Season.
With the colder weather the days shorten and we enter the time that the body’s metabolic functions slow down and it is wise to save our energy, rest more and keep warm, to be in tune with nature.
You should be very concerned when your daytime body temperature reaches only 36 degrees or less. If this happens, it means your immune system is under stress. You are subject to viral infections and your immune system is unable to respond to the infection. You are at high risk of catching cold or flu.
A lower body temperature condition occurs during sleep and when under stress. Viruses can only replicate in humans with a stress-lowered body temperature or when exposed to cold winter weather. This might explain why cold and flu viruses spread more often during the winter and why some people may get four or more colds per year and some other people seem never to catch a cold. It all depends on their immune responses.
With the colder weather the energy level of our lungs is subjected to strain. There is a strong connection between the health of our lungs and our skin.
Dry body brushing orSalt glow body treatment can effectively improve blood circulation and increase the flow of vital energy thus strengthening the lungs.
Adequate hydration is crucial for our health; especially in the winter the skin tends to be dehydrated due to wind exposure. I suggest you should be very concerned about the quality of the water you drink. If you are thinking of buying or upgrading your water purifier, please ask me for advice.
Fever is a normal and natural immune system response to a viral infection, and is our own first line of defence against any viral infection. When our body temperature rises to 38.3 degrees Celsius it’s our system’s reaction to a viral infection. That is a normal immune system response – and that will stop viral DNA replication.
The simple way to prevent or cure very early stage viral infection in the human body is to raise the body temperature above normal e.g. by having a Scandinavian sauna .
Additionally, the prescription of Chinese herbs and Toyohari Acupuncture can help to balance and strengthen the energy flow in relating meridians thus strengthening your immune system to offset flu and colds this winter.

HMRC is warning members of the public of a worrying iTunes gift card scam. The fraudsters are cold calling victims purporting to work for HMRC and warning them that they owe HMRC large amounts of tax which they can only pay off using digital vouchers and gift cards, including those used for Apple’s iTunes Store.
Victims are told to go to a local shop, buy these vouchers, and then read out the redemption code to the scammer who remains on the line the whole time. These scammers are ruthless and prey on elderly and vulnerable members of society.
Whilst this sounds far-fetched, there have been over 1,500 reports of this scam made to Action Fraud, the UK’s national fraud reporting centre between January 2016 and August 2017 and the number of reported incidents has increased over recent months. Action Fraud has reported that the vast majority of the victims are aged over 65 and suffered an average financial loss of £1,150 each.
The fraudsters, who collect money using digital vouchers such as iTunes gift cards, make the fraud almost impossible to trace as the digital vouchers can be easily redeemed or the voucher codes simply sold on for cash. The scammers don’t need the physical gift card to redeem the value, they simply coerce victims to read out the serial code on the back of the card over the phone.
To be clear, HMRC never asks for payment by way of digital vouchers such as those mentioned in this article and none of these electronic vouchers are valid ways of making a payment of an outstanding debt to HMRC. Apple has also published a support page on their website warning users of a number of iTunes gift card scams and reminding people not to provide the numbers on the back of any redemption card to someone you do not know. Any potential frauds should be reported to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.T.212.967.4899 | mail@ippodogallery.com |

We are referring to opening a locked car door when a key is stuck inside, as most people think. Auto locksmith is the most frequently requested service provided by Hawklocksmith. But, that’s only scratching the service of what we do at Hawklocksmith. We offer an array of unlocking and lock installation services.
It is well known that nowadays many people have keyless entry systems, so that means that automotive locksmiths aren’t so much needed? That is far from true, actually we can save customers a significant amount of money by repairing these systems or even installing a new one. Usually auto manufacturer’s guide will suggest that you call the dealer and get a new system, however the price could be much bigger than if it’s changed by a Hawklocksmith, so why should you waste the extra money..Distant Recurrence Risk of Hormone-Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer Steady 20 Years After Initial Diagnosis
After surgery, women diagnosed with early-stage, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer usually take hormonal therapy medicine to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurrence). Recurrence can be local (the cancer coming back in the breast area), regional (coming back in the chest wall or area near the breast), or distant/metastatic (the cancer coming back in a part of the body away from the breast, such as the bones or liver)..
For many years, the standard of care was for a woman to take hormonal therapy for 5 years after breast cancer surgery. In 2012 and 2013, large studies found that 10 years of tamoxifen was better than 5 because it:
- lowered the incidence of breast cancer recurrence
- reduced the number of deaths from breast cancer
- improved overall survival
Some research has suggested that taking Femara for 10 years instead of 5 may offer some benefits, but only for very specific women. Taking an aromatase inhibitor for 10 years isn’t the standard of care yet.
While taking tamoxifen for 10 years instead of 5 offers more benefits, tamoxifen does cause side effects, some of them serious. Hot flashes and night sweats are common tamoxifen side effects. In rare cases, tamoxifen can cause dangerous blood clots. Tamoxifen also may increase the risk of endometrial cancer in some women. So the benefits of taking tamoxifen for 10 years have to be weighed against 10 years of possible side effects.
If doctors knew the specific risk of distant recurrence of a breast cancer after 5 years of hormonal therapy, it could help decide whether to extend hormonal therapy to 10 years.
A study suggests that after 5 years of hormonal therapy, the risk of distant recurrence is still sizable, even 20 years after the initial diagnosis. The risk of distant recurrence is strongly linked to the characteristics of the cancer, including cancer size and number of positive lymph nodes.
The research was published in the Nov. 9, 2017 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Read the abstract of “20-Year Risks of Breast-Cancer Recurrence after Stopping Endocrine Therapy at 5 Years.”
This study was a meta-analysis, which means the researchers analyzed results from previously published studies. In this case, the researchers looked at 88 studies involving 62,923 women diagnosed with early-stage, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer who had no evidence of disease after 5 years of hormonal therapy after surgery.
The women were all younger than 75 when they were first diagnosed, and all were diagnosed between 1976 and 2011.
All the breast cancers were classified as either:
- T1: 2 cm or smaller in size
- T2: 2.1 cm to 5 cm in size
and had fewer than 10 positive lymph nodes.
None of the cancers were metastatic.
About half the women had lumpectomy and half the women had mastectomy to remove the cancer. Approximately 74% of the women who had positive lymph nodes were treated with chemotherapy. Only about 25% of the women diagnosed with HER2-positive disease were scheduled to be treated with Herceptin (chemical name: trastuzumab).
All the women were scheduled to take hormonal therapy for 5 years and then stop.
The researchers looked at the rates of distant recurrence up to 20 years after diagnosis, grouping the women by number of positive lymph nodes. They also looked at rates of death from breast cancer. The researchers then used statistical analysis to see if there were links between the characteristics of the cancer and the rates of distant recurrence.
Within each group of women, distant recurrences occurred steadily during the 20 years after diagnosis. Specific 20-year risks of distant recurrence were:
- 22% for women with zero positive lymph nodes
- 31% for women with one to three positive lymph nodes
- 52% for women with four to nine positive lymph nodes
As the researchers expected, the annual rates of death from breast cancer were low during the first 5 years after initial diagnosis. But after year 5, the annual rates of death from breast cancer and distant recurrence were similar. Specific 20-year risks of death from breast cancer were:
- 15% for women with zero positive lymph nodes
- 28% for women with one to three positive lymph nodes
- 49% for women with four to nine positive lymph nodes
The researchers then looked at the cumulative risk of distant recurrence and the cumulative risk of death from breast cancer from 5 to 20 years after diagnosis based on the classification and lymph node status of the cancer. Cumulative risk is the total risk that something will happen over.
Cumulative risk of distant recurrence at 20 years was:
- 13% for T1 cancer with zero positive lymph nodes
- 20% for T1 cancer with one to three positive lymph nodes
- 34% for T1 cancer with four to nine positive lymph nodes
- 19% for T2 cancer with zero positive lymph nodes
- 26% for T2 cancer with one to three positive lymph nodes
- 41% for T2 cancer with four to nine positive lymph nodes
The cumulative risk of distant recurrence was strongly related to the original classification and lymph node status of the cancer.
Cumulative risk of death from breast cancer at 20 years was:
- 7% for T1 cancer with zero positive lymph nodes
- 13% for T1 cancer with one to three positive lymph nodes
- 22% for T1 cancer with four to nine positive lymph nodes
- 13% for T2 cancer with zero positive lymph nodes
- 20% for T2 cancer with one to three positive lymph nodes
- 29% for T2 cancer with four to nine positive lymph nodes
As with distant recurrence, the cumulative risk of death from breast cancer was strongly related to the original classification and lymph node status of the cancer.
"Even though these women remained free of recurrence in the first 5 years, the risk of having the cancer recur elsewhere (for example in the bone, liver, or lung) from years 5 to 20 remained constant," said senior study author Daniel F. Hayes, M.D., Stuart B. Padnos Professor of Breast Cancer Research at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center.
"It is remarkable that breast cancer can remain dormant for so long and then spread many years later with this risk remaining the same year after year and still strongly related to the size of the original cancer and whether it had spread to the nodes," said Hongchao Pan, Ph.D., M.Sc., lead author from the University of Oxford.
While these risk numbers seem concerning, we know that the risk of recurrence doesn’t ever go down to zero.
"The article doesn't tell the breast cancer community anything they didn't already know, which is that cancer risk doesn't go down to zero for patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer," said Jennifer Litton, M.D., of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, who was not involved in the analysis, in an interview. "I wouldn't want women to panic when they see this. This is what was happening 20 years ago, and we know women are living longer, decade by decade when they are diagnosed.
"It confirms that there is a lifelong risk,” she continued. “We still need to do better with our chemotherapy, we need to do better with our anti-estrogen therapies. A lot of people are looking into different combinations in clinical trials, as far as the length of time that women are on these therapies."
It’s important to know that the women in this analysis were diagnosed up to 30 years ago. Breast cancer treatment has improved dramatically in that time, so women who have been diagnosed more recently will have a lower risk of distant recurrence.
Also, not all the women in the studies analyzed completed the full 5 years of hormonal therapy. Up to 31% of the women in some of the studies didn’t complete treatment, which may have led to higher rates of distant recurrence. Hormonal Therapy. You can read about why it’s so important to stick to your treatment plan, as well as ways to manage side effects. If you’re taking hormonal therapy after surgery now, stick with it as prescribed. If you’re thinking of stopping early, talk to your doctor first. Together, you can find a solution that is best for you.Discussion in 'TSC' started by RammerJammer, Feb 14, 2017.

There is a grand total of 5 different options to choose, ranging in cost from $25-$60. The baseline $25 plan is pretty barebones, netting you unlimited talk and text but absolutely no data. In order to access the web you are gonna have to settle for WI-FI networks. The step up above that plan, comes in at $30, You get unlimited data access, with 5GB at 4G speeds, unlimited text, but only 100 minutes of talk.
Above these plans are the three that merely build upon prior offerings. The $40, $50, and $60 plans will all net you unlimited talk and text, with 3GB, 5GB, and 10GB respectively. The same priced older versions of these plans used to get you about half the data for the same exact price. These new plans also come with Music Unlimited (aka Music Freedom), Data Maximizer (aka the controversial binge on), and Smartphone Equality which guarantees that, if you make 12 straight on time phone payments, you will receive the best up front phone pricing afterwards.
If international calling is a must, depending on the countries you need to call, there are three different options to supplement the plans above. These add-ons range from $5 for unlimited calling to and from the United States, up to $15 for unlimited calling to mobile phones in 30+ countries.
These new plans seem to be a pretty good deal. They aren’t exactly groundbreaking, but they are giving you double the data for the exact same price as the old plans.

United States“As a U.S. architect involved in global sustainable design for more than 30 years, I'm passionate about creating beautiful, ultimately energy efficient buildings. To bring my visions to life, I've had to seek out the highest-performing products from around the world.
My partner Klaus Müller and his team in Germany link us to the ultimate quality European made products. I found Klaus in 2004 while searching in Germany for an expert to build the windows and doors for my design of the first certified Passive House in North America – das BioHaus at Concordia Colleges Language Villages. After building the BioHaus, Klaus and I knew we had to share this exciting new window and door technology with U.S. customers. We knew that you too would love this amazing experience of designing with, building with and living in the highest level of comfort, beauty and performance in the world.
Soon after, we achieved another notable first when we designed a double hung lookalike window for a Brooklyn brownstone in a landmark designated area of New York City. Our 'Brooklyn' window seamlessly integrated top-of-the-line European engineering into a historical preservation project, proving that our windows can work with any architectural aesthetic.
My family wanted to be involved in the mission to bring the world's best windows and doors to North America. Here in North America my son Robert leads sales and marketing and my son Seth serves as our technical expert, handling installation as the leader of the Tanner Construction team.
We believe there can be no compromise between aesthetics and performance, so our windows and doors are as intelligently crafted as they are beautiful, inside and out. That's why I've helped bring this extraordinary vision to North America and why I'm excited to share the possibilities of Tanner Windows and Doors with you for your next projects.
With my commitment to beautiful, comfortable, and uncompromisingly sustainable design, I will help you create your finest–with Tanner Windows and Doors.”FORMER Worcester national stars Les Sanders and Keith Hunt successfully held on to their lead to be crowned the Worcester and District United Anglers' Association Winter League champions.
Ice-breaking tactics were needed to make this rearranged last round on the canal at Perdiswell take place and as expected catches were seriously affected with less than 1lb needed to win on the day.
Top rod was Nick Vaughan who on peg 30 above the walk-over bridge took a dozen tiny perch on worm bait to put a winning 0lb 15oz 3dr onto the scales.
Greenman’s Richard Brewer came second on peg 34 also with small perch but he did include a bonus rudd in his 0-9-9 net to beat Lee Davey who took 0-7-4 from peg 62 for third place.
On the day Vaughan and Mick Samson were joint first with Sanders and Hunt as both pairs scored three points.
The overall league after five rounds saw Sanders and Hunt on top with 34 points followed by Samson and Vaughan with 41.
In joint third spot on 44 were Brewer and Bob Patrick along with Lee Davey and Lee Davies.
Worcester’s Rob Wilson narrowly won the Woodland View Sunday open when he took 34-8 from Deans pool peg 63.
John Booth came second on peg 45 with 31-4 and in third was Ron Phero weighing 26-10.
The previous day's fur and feather contest on Back Deans saw Gary Kirkham win with 14-2 from peg 43.
John Astle was second with 12-4 and in third came Andy Morrison weighing 9-12.

Brazil
The conversation slowly and lazily drifted into the matter of rates. There
was general agreement that we are underpaid. Different people said that
Indian and Chinese agencies were spoiling the market, Latin-American agencies
were no good and even some North-American and West-European agencies offered
terrible rates far below what anybody would consider fair. There was general
agreement on that, too.
Someone said it would be our costs plus a fair margin to pay for our efforts. Rosetta raised another two embarrassing questions: (1) what our costs were
and (2) what constituted a “fair margin.”
People began to feel uneasy. Everybody agreed that we had costs. Nobody was sure how much those costs amounted to. We had to buy our tools, of course, and
many of us use more than one CAT tool these days. Those are called fixed costs. And agencies used the CAT tools to pay us less than they used to. Besides,
all of us had spent a lot of time and money studying and wanted to recover our investments, something accountants call “amortizing pre-operating
expenses.” And of course investments never ended: new dictionaries, conferences, courses, computers, gadgets, the list is endless. And we are not
even counting taxes, utilities, location, office supplies.“And coffee,” added a pleasant-looking young person who also did Spanish.
“Yes,” Rosetta said, “has anybody quantified that?” No, nobody had. Worse, nobody knew how to. In other words, how much should you
charge to each word you translate to amortize fixed costs and pre-operating expenses? Does that mean that people who have lower costs should charge less?
And our costsat least some of themare probably falling: in pre-historic times one had to spend a small fortune to buy a computer and use it in
translating; nowadays everybody has at least one powerful computer, which often doubles as an entertainment center. “Should we then lower our
rates?” dared Rosetta. There was a chorus of angry “noes!”
Rosetta changed the tack: “I dare say translation is a labor-intensive activity with very low indirect and fixed costs, and
that most of what we charge goes into our pockets.” “Anything wrong with that?” growled an overweight German translator. “No, of
course not,” answered Rosetta sweetly. “But if we are to add a fair margin, we ought to know what a fair margin amounts to.”
“In fact,” she continued, “this so-called fair margin is our wages.”
“Our pay, as you define it, Rosetta, should be enough to live decently without breaking our backs for endless hours in front of a computer
screen.” A discussion ensued on how much one needed to “live a decent life.” Rosetta, always ready to ask the provoking question,
enquired whether people who led a simple life should charge less than people who enjoyed more sophisticated ways.
Before anyone had the time to answer, a no-nonsense Russian translator cut in: “Look, this discussion is useless. Even if we could determine the
exact and fair price for translation or any other thing, for that matter, we could never be sure anyone, seller or buyer, would agree to it. Prices are
not, have never been and will never be determined by costs. Prices are determined by supply and demand. Problem is there are far too many translators.
Everybody wants to be a translator these days. We ought to close the shop and admit only people who are really prepared to be professionals.“
“Aw, c’mon, not that, again,” commented Xavier, the Spanish translator who had begun five different college courses and completed none.
“You want us to believe that old story that only people with a degree in translation studies can translate. You haven’t seen the things I
have.”
Rosetta took the reins in hand again: “Even if we could determine in advance who is and who is not worthy of being called a translator, and create
some kind of law saying that only accredited, certified or whatnotted translators would be allowed to translate, we would not be safe.”
“Why?” asked a bearded and bespectacled Czech. “Because,” answered Rosetta, “we could not prevent those guys who are in from sharing a job with people who are out. It is easy to know who signs the translation, but it is impossible to know who actually did
it.”
An elderly Arabic translator, who had kept his peace thus far, decided to intervene: “I can see nothing wrong in sharing a job with a deserving
colleague. I have helped more than one person into the profession this way.” “You see,” said Rosetta “you may have and you may have
chosen worthy people and you may have edited their work into perfect translations, but that practice defeats the whole idea of restricting the practice of
translation to approved persons: in fact, you ran a one-man self-appointed private accreditation board yourself. And made a few bucks on top of it.”
“But Ibrahim touched on a very interesting point,” said the bearded Czech young man, “if a bit sideways. Newbies. Newbies will accept
anything at any price, and we often lose work because some newbie will grab it for peanuts.”
Dmitri, the Russian, quickly answered while Rosetta was slowly enjoying another sip of her wine: “Very good, Bedrich, you were never a newbie and have
never accepted a low-paying job in your life, have you? Let’s be realistic for a change.” “And if a newbie charged as much as we
do, you would be whining about people still wet behind their ears making as much money as seasoned translators like us,” added Georg, the overweight
German. “The problem”, contested an elderly pipe-smoking French translator, “is that nobody is interested in quality. All they want to
know is price. Jobs go to the lowest bidder and that is that.”
Rosetta intervened again “Sorry, Pierre, I cannot agree. If it were true, we would be out of work a long time ago. You see, it is just like the wine
you and I enjoy so much: some people demand Château Lafitte, but others are quite happy with Château Maroc or cannot afford anything better. And
many of the guys who make Château Maroc today will be producing Château Lafitte tomorrow.”
Rosetta took a last sip at her wine. It was neither Château Lafitte nor Château Maroc, but a generous, honest mid-priced Burgundy. She felt like
suggesting another bottle, but decided against it. It was getting late and she had a train to catch. Tomorrow would be another day and she had a big job to
handle. As it often happens in those cases, it seems that the others had the same idea. They asked for the check, divided the bill among them, paid it and
went their several ways. Next month, they would meet again, in the same small restaurant, order food and drink and the conversation would slowly and lazily
drift into the matter of rates.
For that is the way life is.You know what it needs? A Rocky Training Montage! And unfortunately, it’s short! Boo…
On the other hand, I guess there is a reason why Chris is psychotic. It turns out that she’s a pawn to this mysterious naked woman.
Um Ms. Mysterious Woman or whoever you are, please put some clothes on!
Meanwhile, Tsubasa Kazanari is in a coma after using swan song. C’mon Tsubasa-chan, please wake up and move on to your life regarding Kanade Amou!
She risked her life to save Hibiki, and it’s your job to accept and protect her!
Well Tsubasa-san, looks like you’ve woken up from a bad dream eh!
For now, she needs to take some rest while Hibiki fights against the Noise!
Meanwhile, Hibiki Tachibana and Ryouko Sakurai are being attacked by the Noise while protecting a case that contains a relic sword called Durandal.
As usual, Chris is the summoner and commander of the Noise.
On the other hand, Ryouko is showing her hidden powers. I wonder if she can sing and become a Symphogear user?
Anyways, time to show the results of Hibiki’s training. That’s right, show Chris how stronger you are!
Needs a badass song to boot instead of Aoi Yuuki singing her lungs out!
On the other hand, seems that the sword Durandal is reacting to Hibiki. However, it’s a great opportunity for Chris to get it!
Not this time though as this bitch can’t have Durandal, only Hibiki Tachibana can wield it!
Also, “ZA WARUDO!” anyone?
But in that case, by the power of
Kyubey Greyskull… HIBIKI TACHIBANA HAS THE POWER!!! Yeah, nothing like having a He-Man moment with Hibiki as she’s hulking out again
Well then, looks like Chris got an “Oh Crap!” face now that she saw the power of Durandal in Hibiki’s hands. Just look at the length of the beam… It might rival Ideon’s sword someday!
Alas, Chris has lost the game and she’s gonna get whipped by her naked master!
So with Chris retreated to her mommy, looks like Hibiki has to learn that “Great power comes great responsibility”.
Also, Ryouko Sakurai is impressed on what she did today!
As for Hibiki, she’s stunned on unleashing her powers that she might forgot the “responsibility” part. But anyways, can’t wait for the next episode.
And as for Durandal, I hope it does not cause an issue to everyone… Those terrorists wants to have a piece of that relic.
well never thought sorta better late than never give saw 1st 5eps oh boy indeed like combine nanoha, madoka, singing, & who know what else put in next.
yea ep.5 yea that ENGLISH speaking wondering why & oh yep so likely either in mid-point eps expect a “heel” turn will happen.

"Here there is a Mexican government analysis triangle to know how to confront what we've been calling the Trump Emergency," said the assistant secretary for Population, Migration and Migration Affairs within the Government Secretariat, Humberto Roque Villanueva. reality TV star said that, unless the country agreed to pay for the wall along the border, he would stop all remittances from Mexicans in the U.S. to their home country – an economic activity that adds billions of dollars to Mexico's economy every year.

"I believe Mr. Trump speaks off the top of his head, and doesn't have a clear idea about financial matters or international accords," Roque said, according to Mexico's El Universal newspaper. "We live in a globalized world, and the United States would have to return to a kind of Middle Ages to prohibit remittances or charge tariffs that aren't charged in other parts of the world.".
Not all Mexican officials are surprised about Trump's success, however.
According to El Universal, the governor of the state of Nuevo León, Jaime Rodríguez Calderón – known universally in Mexico by his nickname, "El Bronco" – shocked Mexico's powerful political parties by winning the governorship as an independent candidate.
Rodríguez Calderón recently told a gathering of businessmen in Monterrey, "I made a bet that Trump would win ... What is Trump doing? He's taking advantage of anger. Everybody says that he's crazy, but that's what they said about me too."

After all this time, I finally got DH to call AmEx to find out if he was sitting on a half million points (he wasn't.) He's had an employer-issued corporate green card for 21 years. He pays the bill, and the employer reimburses. Unlike many other members here, he didn't seem to have rewards.
The deal is that if he wants to pay $75/year, they will enroll the card in Membership Rewards. Alas, no credit for all the charges he's had over the years. He probably puts about $10K of charges on it a year, and the fee would be the equivalent of 7500 points, so he isn't going to bother.
But if anyone is in a similar situation, you can collect rewards if you're willing to pay.
My guess is that the employers have the option of choosing to let employees get points or not --probably a lower fee for them if they don't, or something.Log In needed $250,000 · Passive Business Opportunities – Keep Your Job – Great ROIReport Ad. $250k to $650k.

Spokane, WA—Bloomsday founder Don Kardong has been hired to take over race director duties of the Lilac Bloomsday Run following the retirement of veteran Race Coordinator Karen Heaps. Kardong has been active as a Board Member and Elite Athlete Coordinator since founding the race in 1977, but this will be his first time as the event’s director.
“Obviously I have a strong interest in Bloomsday’s ongoing success,” said Kardong, “and I look forward to working with our Board of Directors, committee members and nearly 5,000 other volunteers in organizing the best possible event for the community.”
Kardong was chosen by the Bloomsday Board of Directors to take over the Bloomsday reins following the retirement of Karen Heaps after this year’s event. Heaps, who has served as Bloomsday Race Coordinator since 1992, helped direct the event through thirteen highly successful years, including 1996, when the event had its largest attendance of 61,298 entrants. She will be on the job through the end of August.
“Karen helped Bloomsday enjoy tremendous success over the years,” said Bloomsday President Al Odenthal, “And we look forward to a similar string of successful Bloomsdays under Don’s leadership.”
In taking over as Bloomsday Race Director, Kardong will be leaving his job as Executive Director of the Children’s Museum of Spokane, a position he has held since July 2002.
Next year’s Lilac Bloomsday Run, the 29th running of the popular 12-kilometer events, is scheduled for May 1, 2005.

“Has anything changed?”
On the surface, this question sounds simple – almost an afterthought. But, as they say, “life happens” during your recruiting process:
- Job seekers gain new skills and experience.
- Interviewees forget important information you discuss during the initial interview.
- Candidates reassess their employment situation – and are presented with new opportunities.
In other words, circumstances can change in an instant – and have a big impact on your recruiting efforts.
So when you reconnect with candidates, never make assumptions. Use these tips to prevent surprises – and increase your chances of hiring your first choice:
From VP Laurie Hyllberg:
- After you receive a candidate’s resume, follow-up to see if he has any additional questions about the position you discussed. Ask if anything changed when he went home to think about the opportunity and talk to his family.
- When scheduling the phone interview, be sure to ask if there is anything coming up on the candidate’s calendar which may require accommodation.
- While preparing a candidate for an interview, or debriefing him afterward, ask:
- What did you think about the company, the hiring manager and the job?
- What is your interest level in the role?
- Has anything changed in your situation at work or at home that I need to be aware of?
From Recruiter Russell Lilly:
- After the interview, ask your candidate if there were any questions he had that the interviewer was unable to answer.
- Specifically ask about other opportunities that the candidate may be pursuing. This can be helpful in identifying his timeline and any potential competing offers down the road.
- If your candidate is considering more than one position, ask him to compare one opportunity to another. This may help you identify his areas of strength or weakness, or better understand his motivations (i.e., why he is seeking a new opportunity).
Knowledge is power.
Use variations of “has anything changed” (like the ones listed above) to find ways to solidify your opportunity in the candidate’s mind, or chip away at another. At the end of the day, a candidate needs to take the position that he feels is the best fit for his goals. Knowing what those are and how your opportunity can address those goals can greatly increase the likelihood of offer acceptance.

Let me share
Got up this morning, which was a good morning cuz I slept until 6:00 and wasn't having a panic attack when I woke up which is VERY good, and went in to the office for a while where I worked on government payroll reports.
THen I met up with Chandra at the Y for an hour of treadmill walking and deep discussion about Life, teenagers, why golfers on tv wear white pants, death, work, therapy, what happens when we wear white pants and sit on something poop colored, what kinds of sweet potatoes she should make for the Saturday night group's Thanksgiving dinner on Sunday, parents and other family relationships and what happens when your brain gets older.... amoungst other topics.
Speaking of brains.... I had a discussion with my therapist the other day and we discussed keeping your brain active via video games so I might have to get one of those brain game thingies. My DIL has one and she loves it and she isn't even old. Because I worry about that stuff especially with my moms recent diagnosis (even though that seems to be called into question now) cuz I have definite brain fart moments. I constantly forget where I parked my car. Once I carried my TV remote out with me thinking it was my cell phone. And apparently my brain is in my butt because when I stand up to go get something I immediately forget what I wanted.
Speaking of McDonalds.......... today I drove Lauren to our Designated Visitation Exchange Spot otherwise known as the In-N-Out burger place off Sand Canyon road which is about halfway between our houses.... and left her there to go home with her dad for a week. Heaven help them both. So then I turned right around and headed back to Lancaster and decided to stop at the McDonalds in Acton to get some cookies. I happen to think McDonalds chocolate chip cookies totally rock. And even though my brain knows that chocolate chip cookies do not equal Love (Hey, look! A Squirrel!!) I still use cookies to fill in the gaps of my emotional pain on occasion. And sometimes I use them to keep me from being boring on the freeway. And sometimes I use them to reward myself for doing something I don't want to do. And sometimes I use food. Period. I admit it
Anyhoooooooooow..... The drive up window person says "Welcome to McDonARDS may I help you?" and i think--- did she just say McDonARDS? I mean, it threw me. For a micro second I almost ordered a fruit plate. Then I came to my senses and ordered the cookies. Now, this particular McDonALDS has a special place in the hearts of the Fenner-Williamson household because it was there that we stopped and bought breakfast one trip to Disneyland and they messed up our order Big Time. Messing up our order was not especially noteworthy except for the fact that they had stuck a sticker on our receipt that said "Double Checked for Accuracy" which has become a catch phrase in our home now. (SQUIRREL)
Soooo anyhow............. when I get up to the pay window I listened carefully to the order lady repeat Welcome to McDonARDS several times. I also heard her use the 'L' sound so apparently she doesn't have a speech impediment...... Isn't that facinating?
See, some of you ask me "LeAnn, how do you come up with your FACINATING blog subjects that make our lives appear dreary in comparison?" I tell you--- pay attention to your own life-- there is facinating stuff going on all around you.

MMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm coooooookieeees, fulfillment, seeeeeex (oooops), coooookieeeeeees. When I need a cookie fix, and this is often because I am a cookie fiend, I too seek out the wonderful cookies at McDonard's. I had some for breakfast on Friday! Sometimes I have them after work cuz I am rewarding myself for just going in and finishing. Soooooo, you are not alone, my friend. There are probably many more out there who will not admit it. You would all do well to just admit it and come clean. Love Stacy
Somebodies been watching UP! It's funny because the squirel gets dead.
I never order cookies at McDonNARDS... but my wife does when she wants me to spend the last $1.06 I have to my name and then not give me a bite....(She is over my shoulder right now bitching about my Iced Coffee that she buys me to hold over my head....AND pointing at my spelling mistakes....PLEASE MAKE HER STOP!!!
AS for anything else at McDonards, it may have been a slip of some kind as I have often thought they used ARDS or NARDS in what they pass off for food...as for " double checked for accuracy"....My cat's patootie could make a better bag check then those cretins.....seriously folks, I could show you if you want.....look deep into my eye!!!!
You live a fasinating life in comparison to mine .. blog on baby.I associated growing up with being done with all childish things and most childlike things. While I grasped the concept of a "childlike" faith, I always thought that growing up eradicated all other childlike tendencies.
In the past few months I've been realizing some things about growing up, and in the last couple weeks, I've been trying to figure out how to share with words, what I was starting to comprehend. At last I decided to just sit down and write everything I've been thinking about lately concerning this whole concept of "growing up".
Growing up doesn't mean freedom in the sense of getting away, and being free from childhood and parental rules. There are a lot of college students and young adults in their early twenties who are living on their own and away from parental guidance and are "free", but they haven't grown up at all. It's kind of ironic,actually, how desperate they are to cast away all ties to childhood, and yet how childish they act. Obviously this isn't the case for everyone but it is for some, and it's the case for enough people that it makes me wonder what really marks "growing up."
Growing up means you learn how take the beauty and the pain together. You learn how to be prudent, and make wise decisions. It means you put aside childish behaviors and childish wants and you recognize your responsibilities for yourself and others.
Growing up is two-sided. Yes you have to live in "reality", but growing up doesn't mean you forget everything you knew as a child. A child is so full of innocense and beauty. A child recognizes truth and goodness. A child will look at the world with an entirely different pair of eyes than an adult. A child will look out at a fresh new snowfall and be excited, excited for the fun and beauty and all the adventures the snow holds. A child won't grumble about having to clear the drive way, or scrape the car, or drive to work or pump the gas in the frigid air. They won't think about all the extra work it will take their parents to get them ready to go out, and then help them get everything off when they come in.
People smile at childhood innocence and sweetness. But as a child grows older, society starts to tell her that she is being childish, that she needs to face reality sooner or later. Oh sure, it's all fun and games for kids, while their kids, but the world tells them that to grow up, they need to leave all these silly fantasies behind.
Children are not run down by the mundane things of life. They see good, and joy and happiness in everything. They see the best potential in things. They don't worry about things. It's true, children don't have to deal with everything that adults have to deal with. Children don't have the responsibilities of life that adults do. Children, for the most part, can be shielded from pain that adults have to live with. Children don't have to make huge important, stressful decisions about their life. But that's just it. That's what growing up is. It's learning to hold on to the things a child knows, while learning to deal with things an adult has to deal with it. It's a balance between remembering how to be childlike, in everything, while dealing with things life throws in our faces.
"What good is an offering to an idol
that can neither taste nor smell?
So it is with afflicted man
who groans at the good things his eyes behold.
Do not give in to sadness,
torment not yourself with brooding;
Gladness of heart is the very life of man,
cheerfulness prolongs his days.
Distract yourself, renew your courage,
drive resentmet far away from you;
For worry has brought death to many,
nor is there aught to be gained from resentment.
Envy and anger shorten one's life,
worry brings on premature old age."

And so as I begin this adventure known as growing up, I will try to place my trust entirely in God and remember to stop and appreciate life, and to truly live each day.
I am learning how to be childlike.
To trust.
To be joyful.
To see the best in everything and everyone.
To recognize the truth and beauty in the world.
And to love.

The level of reliance by patients on the skilled nursing facility is increasing the need for nursing care providers to perform better and improve services. An Indianapolis skilled nursing facility can help with making a course of action for the recovery, active recuperation, and any other sort of nursing need to administer to patients who require serious follow-up health care to heal after hospitalization.
Skilled nursing is accessible at a national level to improve and deliver on the health requirements of patients with long-term sicknesses, illnesses, or incapacities. Services are updated regularly and can satisfy the desires and needs of patients at a higher level of care than can be provided in the home. This is an immense change from the home setting because skilled nursing care has more capabilities that benefit the patients and allows them to better control their wellbeing and get healthy faster according to their needs for an effective recovery.
The Indianapolis home health care helps grown-ups, seniors, and pediatric patients remain securely in the home setting and maintain a level of care that makes re-hospitalization unnecessary. These home health agencies are like nursing care suppliers for the home because they incorporate nursing, rehabilitative, recovery, and assistive home health care services.
The skilled nursing care services and treatments incorporate the medical, physical and emotional well-being of patients through dietary advising, medication administration, restorative supplies, basic medical transportation and so forth. Patient plans are made and sorted out up front and regular reports about patients well-being and progress are kept up to date. This encourages the nursing staff to address the patient needs by continually analyzing outcomes and progress. The nursing care plans are designed and refreshed regularly to accomplish greater quality recuperation of the patients.
A Denver skilled nursing facility also guarantees assistance that is medical and therapeutic in nature to help patients seeking medical treatment after an injury, illness or hospitalization and who are looking for a fast recovery. The nursing care providers incorporate experts to address the conditions of the patients and give them best medical care.
The nursing care services and healing centers are the mainstays of intense post-acute care. Recovery hospitals meet the recovery needs at a lesser cost than a hospital or general doctor's facilities and they specifically specialize in an elevated amount of expert treatments and skilled nursing facilities for post-acute care. The positive view and impact of the post-acute care had changed the medical services framework and urged healthcare providers to increase the quality of their services.House Coloring Pages For Seniors Coloring Panda Colouring Pages 7.

Yikes. Guess I'm not very good at this blogger business. Anyway, hello to you all. There have been some changes in my life. First and foremost, I lost my sweet dog, Tess. She died peacefully in my arms on November 9th. She was 17 years old. I miss her very much. She was the best dog. Second, I am once again working as a Title Examiner for my favorite boss, Ms. Beth Schumacher. On the writing front, I now have five novels started and I'm not sure which one I'll finish. But whichever one it is, I'll have to hunt down a new publisher. Ahh, the trials and tribulations of writing. Lastly, my short story Waiting For William has been published in the short story anthology, VOICES FROM THE HERD. All proceeds from the book benefit the Just Buffalo Literary Society. Pick up a copy at Voices. I shall try not to take so long to post again. -- Diane
Hi, Everyone. Yes, the website has changed. It’s been re-designed and we added a message board. So, people, leave me a message. Since last I wrote, I survived being downsized by SecoLink Settlement Services and I got a new day job with Old Republic Title. I’ve written a few more songs, one of which was inspired by the SecoLink layoff. You can read the lyrics here on the website under the Works tab. I also made a discovery. That discovery being: I was finishing the wrong novel first! A short time ago, I told you all that I had two novels close to completion and that I’d decided to finish Loving Kyle before Time in Buffalo. Alas, the other day I was hard at work on Loving Kyle and right in the middle of a chapter I realized that Time in Buffalo has to come before Loving Kyle. Reason being, as the stories developed, the same character fit in both books but since the events in Time in Buffalo occur before those in Loving Kyle…well, you see what I mean.
Anyway, I hope you like the new site. Talk to you again soon.Posts for tag: Indiana ash trees

Final Song - "Brawl for All"!Nicolas Cage is reportedly being sued by a real estate company.
Red Curb Investments claim that the actor, his accountant and his mortgage broker defrauded them by not disclosing details of the actor's financial problems, People reports. The company has also said that Cage owes them more than $5m (Â£3m) in loans.
The lawsuit says: "[Our client] was assured that Cage had substantial assets consisting of high-end residential property, yachts, airplanes, antiques, custom automobiles, jewellery, furs... to assure repayment of the [loan]. The values of Cage's assets were grossly exaggerated."
However, Cage's lawyer Marty Singer said: "Any claims that Nic Cage engaged in fraud or wrongful conduct is absurd and ridiculous."
Red Curb Investments is reportedly seeking a total of $36.7m (Â£22.9m) for the loans, interest, damages, attorney's fees and other costs.
Cage is also being sued by his ex-girlfriend for fraud and breach of contract, while a bank has also filed a lawsuit against him after he failed to repay a loan.
Meanwhile, Cage, who owes $6.3m (Â£3.9m) in unpaid taxes, is suing his former business manager for leading him towards "financial ruin".As the US does not have a specific governing body responsible for assessing each university and education program in the country, accreditation agencies help to keep the standards of learning programs in check

To show you the futility of being on a wait list, let’s look at the odds. You can find the wait list odds of any school by heading to the College Board’s Big Future website. Type in the name of any school and then click its Applying hyperlink.
Here are Notre Dame’s wait list stats from last year:
As you can see, the number of applicants offered a spot on Notre Dame’s waiting list was nearly as many students as the eventual freshman class! This wait-list overkill, by the way, is all too common. Many schools put an obscene number of students on the wait list. Last year at Notre Dame 951 rejected students accepted a place on the wait list, but only seven were eventually offered spots.
Why do schools put
A New Way to Search for College Scholarships
¨When they look at Stanford’s admission rate of 7%, they don’t seem to think it applies to them. If anybody can explain this, I’d love to hear it.¨
First off, the parents of these students and these students are ignorant. Their grades make them feel somewhat superior to their peers and give them a heightened sense of self-confidence. In essence, this egotistical feeling carries over to when they’re applying to college. People don’t understand that most of the applicants to schools like Stanford, Yale, and Harvard already have the grades to get in. Whenever these kids get asked where they’re applying, they tell the adult whatever ivy-league they’re applying to while the adult responds with, “well, you’re gonna need the grades to get in.” Soon after this remark it’s not uncommon to see the student reciting his high school transcript and test scores. These kids think they’re special because people around them are impressed with their academic achievements, while not fully understanding that whoever is applying to those crazy ivy league schools is already smart enough to be admitted. People not understanding this fact contributes to the confidence that academically “superior” students feel. Nobody tells these kids that they’re not special, so naturally they’re gonna feel like god’s gift when applying to such institutions.
Excellent observations Pablo! I couldn’t agree more!
Lynn O’Shaughnessy
Really, Lynn? You couldn’t agree more with Pablo’s comment?
It’s incredibly insulting to kids who have worked very hard throughout their lives, many without any ego or expectation. It’s presumptuous for Pablo to assume he knows how these students feel or how they presented themselves during the application process. He sounds arrogant and harsh, which is his prerogative. What really troubles me, Lynn, is that you think his observations are excellent and couldn’t agree more. That’s very telling, and most disappointing.
“First off, the parents of these students and these students are ignorant. Their grades make them feel somewhat superior to their peers and give them a heightened sense of self-confidence. In essence, this egotistical feeling carries over to when they’re applying to college….. Nobody tells these kids that they’re not special, so naturally they’re gonna feel like god’s gift when applying to such institutions.”
Mr. Pablo:
Are you a student? Have you studied in high school in the 21st century? You have no right to make such a claim because you have not experienced our lives. You call us egotistical for applying to such schools because you think numbers and letters are what motivate us, but you are wrong. I am insulted that you think I am so stupid to not be aware of the other factors that come into play. I work my a** off day and night, with 3 hours of sleep, to keep up with the hardest courses offered at my STEM Magnet school in the most competitive county of the United States while managing internships, extracurricular activities, and a job. Majority of the students put on the wait list are like me. They work hard and are good citizens; and they ARE special. We apply because we deserve it. And so there is a sliver of hope that we may be a part of that 7%. When I was not given a spot in many of the nation’s top universities, I accepted it. I know there are many, many students who deserve it as much and much more than I do. I agree with this article’s opinion that if you are put on a wait-list, you should not expect to get off of it. But shame on you for putting us down, claiming we should not have even applied just because we are not super-geniuses or natural entrepreneurs.
I would like to make a point that nobody is seeming to get a handle on and that is the majority of students that are accepted that are wealthy white students is because the majority of qualified applicants are wealthy white students. The reason that there are a lot of wealthy Asian’s admitted is because there are a lot of qualified wealthy Asian’s that have applied. The cold hard facts is that it is easier to be successful in high school if you have a stable family life that supports the child’s education, hence more highly qualified applicants. The reason that students and parents have expectations that their child will get accepted is because their child is qualified to attend. The reality is that 94 out of every 100 students will be rejected from Stanford, and the 6 that make the cut, look pretty much like 30 kids that didn’t. Twenty years ago, students didn’t feel the need to apply to 10 to 15 schools in hopes that they might get accepted, they applied to 3 or 5 where they “met the benchmark”. However, today children are pushed harder to achieve more at a younger age and, therefore, are easily lost amidst the myriad of qualified students. School’s no longer look at a student, they look at the class an choose students that will create a well-balanced class. An applicant can have a 4.0 GPA with 15 AP courses, a 2400 on his SAT and 36 on his ACT, Varsity athlete and President of Student Council with 300 hours of community service and if the student admitted right before him has the same resume, he is put on the waitlist because every one of the top schools can fill their entire freshman class with 4.0 students with a 2300-2400 on their SAT. Under represented minority groups have a higher acceptance rate among their peers, because there aren’t as many qualified applicants. Those are the cold hard facts.
Excellent reply, Sean. Your answer was much more adult-like and thought out than the previous two. As a parent who’s son who just got deferred from Harvard, rejected from MIT, and wait-listed by U of Chicago, I can tell you the process is very humbling and gut-wrenching. Yes, he IS special, he’s the top student of his class with a 4.6 GPA, 2300 SAT, plus 770 Math, 770 Literature, and 800 Biology on his SAT
II subject test scores, with amazing extracurriculars showing leadership and innovation. He worked hard to get here and has a right to dream…of getting into one of the nation’s top colleges, because HE believes it will be the key to his future prospects.
What most people don’t mention is that the process is in no way shape or form a “fair” process. For example, while the colleges boast of “record high applicants..blah blah blah”, they will take someone less qualified, (in some cases MUCH LESS) because they are either minority / ethically diverse / international, because they are trying to fulfill their diversity quota (another meaningless thing colleges like to brag about). And let’s not forget all the cronyism and “who knows who that’s on the board or admissions committee”, and large donations (some last minute) and other corrupt unethical practices going on these days. This politically correct crap is destroying our society. And I am talking as someone who is from the Middle East, but not superwealthy to “buy” our way into college.
I thought it was all about merit and accomplishments, not if you’re black or white or hispanic? It’s truly disgusting how the colleges violate the very principles that like to boast about.
So it is now March 17 and we have John’s Hopkin’s responding tomorrow. He already got into Emory as a merit honors scholarship prospect, Washington University in ST. Louis, and UC Santa Barbara. We will know by first week of April and what our choices will be.
Let’s see how this pans out.
I would like to respond to the author’s question of explaining why parents of “brilliant students” have expectations of acceptance to a school with a 7% acceptance rate. First, one child I know, for example, has been in the top .00001% in virtually everything he has done since birth, especially when compared with same aged peers. He was in the top of his high school, perfect SAT’s, ACT’s and SAT subject tests, and went on to compete locally and nationally, more often than not placing first in a group of students considered the BEST in math and science in the country. He then went on to compete INTERNATIONALLY winning Gold medals (yes, plural) and placing anywhere from 1st to 10th place (leaving out more specifics for confidentiality reasons). He didn’t stop there. He earned awards in other subject areas, won National awards for independent research, was president and captain of clubs (ie: leadership roles), earned Varsity Sports letters, (so he was well-rounded in addition to being “lobsidedly accomplished”), was extraordinarily respected by peers and adults alike, and so on and so forth. (And yes, he did community service too!)
So, here is a boy who has successfully competed with national and international students and came out on top time and time again, so why WOULDN’T his parents expect him to be EASILY accepted into the top 7%??!!
Moreso, I think accountability/transparency in a college’s selection process needs to be made in a case like this where one top school rejects or defers him, but several Ivy Leagues did offer admittance. (And all were essentially equally great fits with his academics, social, and extracurricular areas matching up with those of all of the schools applied to). For ex., how does the University of Chicago explain why a NUMBER of students accepted EARLY to Harvard, Princeton, and/or Yale,are wait-listed or rejected to their school? It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to parents. (And oh, if any posters here have any concrete answers to my last question, please feel free to comment).
Admissions at top schools work like this: if you meet their standards all around, you are put into a pool of possible choices. Large numbers of underrepresented minorities and women get put in their own category to fill a certain percentage, and thus have very high odds. Students without these factors get put into the large pool. Some adjustments are made for application quality overall (a 2400 will have better chances than a 2200), but otherwise from here selection is random. Admissions offices will invariably say otherwise to save face, and they do work fairly hard to determine these pools, but it doesn’t change the way the cookie crumbles. By the way: nobody is a shoe-in at any school with less than 40 percent acceptance rates.
WKach,
I wonder where in the world you get your information! About 1% of minorities benefit from higher-ed affirmative action. It is mostly practiced at some (and certainly not all) elite liberal arts colleges and some private universities, but the slots available are quite small. I am stunned that you think women benefit from preferential treatment. They can have higher admit rates at some engineering schools where schools need more women, but that is it. Men can have an advantage at liberal arts colleges and there has been press about how talented women are getting turned down at some colleges because more underqualified men need to be admitted so the gender percentage does not get too out of whack. Women represent 57% of college students.
The students who receive preferential treatment at the vast majority of colleges and universities are rich students. Nobody seems to bitch about that though.

Dana:
If people realized that holistic admissions means that admissions to the highly selective elites is more like dating than a strict list ordering, they’d understand better. To give an analogy, just because a certain billionaire wants to marry you doesn’t mean that a certain other billionaire wants to marry you.
Also, you seem not to realize that it’s actually easier to be accepted EA in to HYP than RD in to the U of Chicago,
Why do you guys keep saying “WHITE and middle class?” I’m African American and I was able to attend Stanford.
White and Asian students are significantly less likely to get into a big name school than African American, Hispanic, or Native American students. One factor in all the major rankings is “diversity”, so those at the top often have spectacularly high numbers of traditionally “underrepresented minorities”. I, for instance, would have had triple the chance of getting into MIT if I were African American. Being female would also have doubled my chances. This is assuming the same academic credentials and test scores. White students are simply less valuable to these schools.
WKach,
Asian students do have a disadvantage at a few of the most elite schools, but at 99.9% of schools Asians have ZERO disadvantage. In fact, Asians are coveted at the vast majority of schools. There are plenty of high-achieving Asians who believe that there are only a couple of dozen schools (nearly all intense research universities) that are worth applying to. Now that is sad.
Lynn O’Shaughnessy
From a student’s perspective, I would just like to say that I’m a little offended by your comments on students “aiming too high,” although the entire message of your writing seems to me a little too generalized.
I applied to 10 schools, only two of which had statistics that were higher than mine. In other words, 8 schools accepted on average students with GPAs, SAT scores, ACT scores, and class ranks approximately equal to or less than mine. Yet I was only accepted at 4 of those 8 schools; the other 4 put me on their waitlists.
I accepted all 4 spots. One school has since informed me that I will be accepted if I renounce my need for financial aid, which I can’t do. Another school has accepted me. The other two have not yet consulted their wait lists.
Furthermore, since Notre Dame seems to be your stellar example in both this and other articles you’ve published, I’d just like to note that two of my friends got off the wait list there.
While it’s true that you’re UNLIKELY to get off a wait list, there are, obviously, people who do. There are strategies to try, even for white, needy, middle-class females such as myself, and if you’re truly unhappy with your options – as I was, after looking at financials – it’s certainly worth a shot.
In our upper-middle-income Chicago suburb, a common dinner party conversation is about how our kids won’t get in to the same schools we attended, or where we once applied and were accepted and chose not to attend. It’s discussed w/a tight smile, because many of these parents thought their kids would go to Notre Dame, or Northwestern, or UoC, and now it’s not a possibility despite the tutors, the test prep, the college consultants, and the alumni contributions.
I recall the Grinnell wait-list has something like 1500 student names on it. Scratch that one too.
Hello, Michelle!
Read in the Chicago Tribune last night that last year Northwestern had 3500 students on their wait-list and not one, not one, made it in off that list. University of Chicago had a similar story, with similarly large numbers for both last year, and now again this year for both schools.
Lynn: You asked why so many parents seem to have a disconnect about the highly selective colleges. I believe it’s because during their (today’s parents) college years, stellar students were accepted to the Ivies, Stanford and MIT more readily. Twenty five years ago, most people didn’t even study for the SAT as they do today. You either scored well, or you didn’t. It’s a different world today.
.”
YES, me too. I guess this has to do with how people process statistical risks. I’ve tried pictures, scatterplots, individual examples…. It is just something that people find really hard to process. It requires holding two really contradictory of bits of information in your head at the same time. 1. Your kid is great and could totally be successful at this school. 2. Most likely they won’t get in. We are a culture that loves beating the odds.
I think it’s easier for people to blame not-getting accepted on something they have no control over, such as race, rather then looking at aspects that theoretically people have control over such as wealth. I find the reaction to the recent Rubin study on “How they get in” very interesting. Everyone jumped on the 42% underrepresented minority figure for importance in getting in but ignored the the 42% exceptional talent number which has a lot to do with wealth. And these were only for schools that looked at institutional fit first rather than academics.
Next everyone is upset because the article says that admissions go back to the underrepresented minority pool if they don’t get as many as they want. But the very same article says that it’s the wealthy that benefit from this tactic more than anyone else. Just look at how many schools where the percentage of students who don’t receive any financial aid at a lot of the prestigious schools easily exceeds the number of minorities or students with Pell Grants. No one wants to talk about the “Full-pay” hook. There are 20 colleges where 40% or more of the students don’t receive any financial aid and I don’t think they’re using it to fund more financially needy students.
As usual Michelle, you make an excellent point. The percentage of full-pay rich kids as places like Harvard, Princeton and Yale, heck all the Ivy League, FAR exceed the number of Pell Grant (poor) kids at these institutions. It’s extremely hard for poor kids, much less minority students, to get into these schools. As mentioned earlier, many of the minorities in these schools are rich foreign students.
Lynn O’Shaughnessy
For all you parents who need relief from the college application syndrome, please look at last week’s episode of “The Middle”. You will appreciate EVERY minute. When will parents not be so wrapped up in their child’s success. The best thing I appreciated from Lynn was her comment on success from not getting into the Ivys. So true.
PS- I am proud to say my son made it to not one, but FOUR wait lists! Close, but no cigar, as they say. And what is he going to do? Accept where he is going, and become a stellar undergrad, and survive to go to graduate school, after all the rest of the college grads give up. And he will have the money to be able to attend the best grad school for the $$. PS- the average seasoned car mechanic makes about $150K/year – just ask your dealer.
To add to Paula’s comment, if those stats are even available, don’t forget “non-wealthy.” if you’re wealthy, you’re far more likely to get in to the elite schools, which Lynn has pointed out many times.
I have heard white middle-class parents complain that the acceptance stats for minorities show preferences that aren’t fair (the anti-affirmative action opinion) but how often do you hear people complain about rich people getting all the advantages? Private schools can admit whomever they choose, and if you’re not rich, it really does seem like a crapshoot.
Michelle also made an interesting comment about the failure of the education system. I recently told a friend with a Ph.D. in a science field that my son, also interested in science, would probably attend a small liberal arts college. She was confused, “Why would he go to a liberal arts school if he likes science?” Maybe the collapse of the Calif. universities, which is sending more kids out of state, will also open minds to all the great colleges across the U.S.
Most of the highly selective schools are “need blind” so a student’s ability to pay does not enter into the admission decision. But I think you do see an inordinate number of “full pays” at some of these schools because many of the students come from educated families, have had access to the best schools and experiences and are cultivated to attend these highly selective schools.
I think that two distinct sets of students are now attending these schools: kids with lots of need who get it all met (often without any loans) and kids whose parents can afford to write the big checks without batting an eye. Middle class kids with no need based on FAFSA and Profile are often choosing to go to less expensive schools or schools that give large merit awards rather than pay out 55K or more per year, especially when there are other children in the family to educate. But there are middle class families who, if a kid gets into an Ivy, will gladly write that full check because they feel the name is “worth it”. But, back to my original question: How do you get in?
HI Paula,
I’d argue that money does come into play so I don’t think any schools can really be considered need blind. Most of the students at Ivies range from affluent to really rich.
I think people would be much better off if they stopped agonizing about how they are going to get into the Ivies. They aren’t going to get in! And that’s okay because there are better choices for undergrads out there. I get insulted when someone calls a liberal arts college a little Ivy. I think that’s insulting to liberal arts colleges. After all, these colleges are completely dedicated to educating undergrads. At the Ivies, undergrads are nowhere near a priority.
Lynn O’Shaughnessy.
Hi Denise,
I think the reaction of your PhD friend just shows how much ignorance there is about college choices. You are more likely to become a PhD in the sciences if you attend a liberal arts college. I wrote a post about this earlier this year:
As for minority preferences, those are small potatoes compared to the preferences of the wealthy. Many, if not most, of the minority students at Ivies are wealthy foreign students.

I share Lynn’s feelings about avoiding these highly selective schools (for many reasons) but let’s put that aside for a moment. I recently received an email from a local high school guidance counselor asking me for suggestions on how to get admitted to an Ivy (for example). She’s feeling pressure from parents. How would you respond (other than look elsewhere)? It would be interesting to see some bio’s and stats of non-legacy, non-minority, non-athletes who were admitted.
There are over 36,000 high schools in the US, each with a valedictorian. Some of those are also in the 21,000 plus students who scored in the 99th percentile or higher on the SAT. That should give people some idea of the odds they’re up against. And given that all of the most competitive schools admit significant numbers of students who aren’t valedictorians or in the top 99% of SAT scorers, the numbers provide only the smallest of baselines.
But people only see the talented individuals in their own world and forget about all the people they don’t know. The number of talented students has continued to grow while people still only seem to “know” about a dozen of so worthy schools to apply to. Talk about a failure of the education system.Chipshoppers.com specializes in supplying common, obsolete and

Bauchau Named First Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professor in Rotorcraft
The University of Maryland welcomes Dr. Olivier Bauchau as the first Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professor in Rotorcraft.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 30, 2015

College Park, Md. – The University of Maryland welcomes Dr. Olivier Bauchau as the first Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professor in Rotorcraft. Bauchau brings thirty-plus years of experience in the rotorcraft field to the university. He is a widely recognized scholar in aeromechanics of rotorcraft, multibody and structural dynamics, composite structures, and wind turbine systems.
Supported through an endowment from Sikorsky and United Technologies, the Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professorship in Rotorcraft is part of the Department of Aerospace Engineering and serves to support enhanced research specialization in areas related to rotorcraft. Sikorsky Aircraft is a world leader in helicopter design, manufacture and service headquartered in Connecticut, and is a subsidiary of United Technologies.
Dr. Bauchau’s work on comprehensive aeromechanics analysis of rotorcraft, modeling of flexible multibody systems involving composite structures, and modeling of rotor lag dampers are pioneering efforts in the rotary-wing field. At Maryland he aims to harness research being done in computational fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, and rotorcraft to contribute to his computational modeling work in both rotorcraft and the wind energy industry.
In addition to an extensive research background, Bauchau brings strong industry and government relationships. He is the architect behind the comprehensive multibody dynamics code, DYMORE, which is widely adopted by companies like Sikorsky and Bell Helicopter, government laboratories such as NASA Ames Research Center and academic institutions. The code is used to model all aspects of helicopter design such as dynamics, aerodynamics, controls, and composite materials.
"It's very exciting to be here," Bauchau said. "Maryland has always had a strong program in rotorcraft, and this professorship sends a very clear signal that Maryland continues to grow and strengthen that area of research."
Bauchau completed his Ph.D. (1981) in Aeronautics & Astronautics at MIT in the area of Structural Dynamics. In 1983, he joined Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering, and Mechanics, and later became Associate Professor with Tenure. In 1995, Bauchau moved to Georgia Tech as a Professor in Aerospace Engineering until 2010, when he joined the University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (Shanghai, China) as a Professor. He joined Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2014 as Professor in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.
Bauchau is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and he has authored two textbooks and published 88 archival journal papers and 175 conference proceedings papers. In 2012, he received the Textbook Excellence Award from the Text and Academic Authors Association. Recognized as an outstanding teacher, Georgia Tech twice awarded him their “Thanks for Being a Great Teacher” Award, and during his academic career, he has advised 22 students who completed their Ph.D. dissertations.
Most recently, ASME recognized his numerous contributions to the field by awarding him the 2016 ASME d’Alembert Award. The award, established in 2005, recognizes his lifelong contributions to the field of multibody system dynamics.
The Igor Sikorsky Distinguished Professorship in Rotorcraft is one of many efforts in the long-term relationship between United Technologies, Sikorsky and the Clark School of Engineering to expand Maryland's rotorcraft curriculum, research programs and intellectual capital while being a continuous source for the world's best rotorcraft engineers..3864 Private Road Heavenly Valley Neighborhood “Sold”

The rhythm and groove, the lyrics and slang and the harp and guitar solos make blues music so great. In New Orleans the piano is the primarily instrument that made the blues big. Throughout the years many blues pianist recorded their albums in New Orleans like Dr. John, Allan Toussaint, Eddie Bo and James Booker. Last few weeks the great blues pianist Cousin Joe inspired me the most.
In 1984 Joe played at a concerthall in New Orleans where he, an old man, performed his favorite songs. I really enjoy cousin Joe’s songs. They are rhythmic, relax and have great themes. Songs like ‘Thats Enough’ and ‘How Come My Dog Don’t Bark’ are a good example of that.
I Dont Want Fortune And Fame, All I Want Is You To Carry My Name, And Thats Enough Yeah Tats Enough Baby Your Loving Is Enough For Me.
His New Orleans concert in 1984 was filmed bij Storyville Films, it is a cool show, Joe performes his bluesiest Piano songs and adds a lot of laughter to his lyrics. Cousin Joe shows he is having a good time. And the song… listen to ‘ New Orleans’ and ‘ Everything Made of Wood Once Was a Tree’. Especially these song are vocally absolute jewells.Hey everybody!

Between the election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860 and his inauguration the following March seven states had withdrawn from the Union. Washington’s vulnerable geographical position between the slave states of Virginia and Maryland, and growing “rumors of an approaching Southern Army—with designs to blow up the public buildings,” created a sense of panic in the city. The Capitol construction had been under the direction of the Department of War, and on May 15, 1861 the project was halted “until after the war.” Thus Walter was forced to leave his greatest work unfinished. In addition, after getting his wife and son to the safety of Philadelphia, Walter abandoned the DC townhouse that he designed and built for his family in the 1850s.

Diary of Thomas Ustick Walter
May 9, 1861
Once his F Street house had been emptied, Walter stayed at Willard’s Hotel at 14th & Pennsylvania Avenue. Despite its reputation as one of Washington’s finest hotels, the architect complained of rotten food and roaches in the tea. The fire (described in his diary) was the last straw. For the next week he would sleep in his empty house and take his meals at Mrs. Irving’s boarding house,” Walter, who enjoyed his wine, gin and “seegars,” negotiated an arrangement with the tee-totaling Mrs. Irving: “I have concluded to eat there while I remain, and they have concluded to let me have my wine—her price for eating is $5 per week; cheap enough. I paid Willard $31 for one week, 2 fires and 2 bottles of wine, the biggest shave I ever had!”

Even superheroes need some time to build a theme park attraction. According to Sally Corporation CEO John Wood, the idea for developing JUSTICE LEAGUE: Battle for Metropolis for Six Flags had been percolating for over a decade.
“We had been talking to Six Flags about using the JUSTICE LEAGUE IP in an attraction for at least ten years, but things really started to move when we approached Six Flags in early 2012,” explains Wood. They talked about the JUSTICE LEAGUE: Alien Invasion 3D attraction Sally was in the process of building at Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia, which opened in September of 2012.
JUSTICE LEAGUE: Alien Invasion 3D is a leisurely paced dark ride that combines a score-based shooting attraction and the JUSTICE LEAGUE theme. Although there is no formal connection between Movie World and the Six Flags parks, Six Flags does have access to the DC Comics IP (which is owned by Time Warner) and park executives knew they wanted an attraction based on the DC Comics characters.
The Australian attraction was an important step forward in the evolution of dark rides. Sally had been installing shooting-gallery style dark rides for many years. Starting in the late 1990s, destination theme parks began adding high-end projection-based media dark rides with motion base vehicles. Alien Invasion was a step towards bringing those concepts and technologies together.
“For the Six Flags ride, we all wanted a new story and ways to integrate the technology to involve visitors more in the show action,” says Wood. “We really felt we were superheroes of the attractions industry, on a mission to bring high-end attractions to life at the smaller parks.”
Six Flags liked what they saw in Australia and saw the potential for more. In 2012, Wood brought in Rich Hill, Creative Director for Sally, to work with Tom Iven, Senior Vice President of U.S. Park Operations, along with Les Hudson and Sam Rhodes, Six Flags Corporate Design, on developing a storyline and concept.
According to Wood, JUSTICE LEAGUE: Battle for Metropolis differs from the Australian version in several significant ways. First, it was important to Six Flags to have a dynamic vehicle that could spin, accelerate quickly, and move in sync with the projected media.

While the park wanted the attraction to appeal to the family market, they also wanted the ride to meet the needs of their thrill seeking population. The second major improvement came courtesy of the Unreal 4 game engine (sourced and integrated by Pure Imagination), which allowed for real-time game play and Alterface Projects’ laser and camera scoring system. This meant that the ride designers could designate anything as a target, and players could rely on the knowing who the “bad guys” are rather than seeking out a specific target shape. Action on the screens reacts to what players shoot at, so the ride becomes much more realistic and intuitive. The powerful game system, coupled with advanced animation and projection systems, elevates the guest experience of this regional park attraction to rival that of a destination park.
Sally played the role of design / build contractor, starting with the conceptualization of the ride package and writing the script. Sally also helped assemble the team of experts that brought the project together. Oceaneering Entertainment Systems handled the ride system, Pure Imagination oversaw CGI production, Wyatt Design Group was the show set designer, Lexington Design & Fabrication provided scenic construction and the gaming system was created by Alterface Projects.
Six Flags opted to open two versions of JUSTICE LEAGUE: Battle for Metropolis, one at Six Flags Over Texas (Arlington, TX) and Six Flags St. Louis (St. Louis, MO). Both sites selected were existing buildings that were retrofitted. In Texas, the ride was going into an old theater, with an additional building added on over the reservoir for the park’s rapids ride. In St. Louis, the ride took over space from “Scooby Doo’s Haunted Mansion” boat ride (also a Sally creation), which required filling in the former boat troughs to create a level floor. Both rides contain the same scenes and show elements. The St. Louis version has more space and has more ride track between the scenes.
The ride’s iconic Joker animatronic also includes technological improvements. Advances in skin materials and new articulation of the character’s mouth make him more lifelike. “Animatronics are constantly evolving,” says Wood. “They are really becoming more of an art form.”

Sally’s Rich Hill gets the superhero’s share of credit for bringing JUSTICE LEAGUE to life. As lead designer on the project he led the ride from concept through installation to opening.
Guests enter the Hall of Justice and learn that several members of the JUSTICE LEAGUE have been captured. They need everyone’s help to find them, free them, and then capture the Joker and Lex Luthor. Guests move on to Cyborg’s lab where they learn about the ride vehicles being provided and the technology riders will use to stun villains and free the heroes.
Guests then grab 3D glasses and enter the six-passenger ride vehicle. According to Hill, the ride was always designed with 3D media in mind. “We wanted the characters and scenes to pop out at guests, and the best way to do that is with 3D,” explains Hill. The team selected RealD for the 3D projection system.
Sometimes it is simple technology that can have a big impact. Hill pointed out that the doors dividing scenes are new sliding doors created by Besam and manufactured by Door Control Inc. A traditional dark ride door swings open, which takes a longer time than a sliding door and uses a lot more real estate. Ride vehicles have to travel forward past the door arc so the doors can close. With sliding doors, the vehicle can turn directions much sooner, freeing up the layout significantly. Hill says he got the idea on a visit to the local grocery store, and has been really pleased with how they have blocked light and sound between the different scenes.
The ride layout takes vehicles through a series of fabricated sets and CG environments. .
Alterface’s interactive devices await guests inside Oceaneering’s Evo-6™ vehicles at the load station. Photos courtesy Sally Corporation and Six Flags.
The six-passenger vehicles for the attraction are Oceaneering’s Evo-6™ product. The JUSTICE LEAGUE attractions were the first installation of the Evo-6 ™, which is derived from an 8-passenger vehicle called Evolution, first debuted in 2005.
Each vehicle has a full motion base capable of 360-degree spins (yaw). The vehicle also contains onboard lighting and audio. Onboard audio playback comes from an Alcorn McBride AM4 Digital Audio Machine. Audio amplification comes from Alcorn’s AmpTraXX amplifier. Both of these units are mounted together using a special bracket that Alcorn designed to save space in the ride vehicle. For both Six Flags attractions, the vehicles also contain a strobe light used sparingly throughout the ride.
The maximum speed for the vehicles is six feet per second, although they rarely go that fast. Oceaneering’s Nathan Marks, project manager for the Evo-6™ vehicles says the gaming element requires slower movement. “When players are aiming at targets, we don’t want to spin them around or move them too quickly along,” explains Marks. “In St. Louis, we had more space between scenes so we are able to take the vehicle up to full speed several times during breaks in the game.” gaming system is noticeably different from the Australian attraction. “The system is largely invisible to the guest,” says Benoit. “The camera and laser system allows virtually anything to become a target.”
In the case of JUSTICE LEAGUE the team took the technology one step further and created moving targets on a fog screen. When Alterface and Sally were working on the Australian ride, they ended up with an extra projector and during the install they used it to try and project 3D onto the fog screen in that attraction. When it worked, one of the Alterface crew set up the gaming system by the fog screen to see if it would read the scoring. It proved to be effective, but it was only temporary. As Rich Hill likes to say: “It was a little secret we kept in our back pocket until the Six Flags projects happened.”
Now, guests round a corner and see a fog screen in front of them with an army of Lex-Bots (small menacing robots sent to protect the villains) appearing to move toward the vehicle. As players shoot at the fog screen the Lex-Bots respond. As the vehicle breaks through the fog screen riders suddenly find themselves in an entirely new scene. The moment is startling and powerful; an effective deployment of existing technologies in an entirely new format. That, in essence, is what makes JUSTICE LEAGUE a success.

With such a dynamic ride environment, the show control systems might be complicated. Not so, says Sally’s Technical Director John Stegall. “Three main systems are able to operate the whole attraction,” says Stegall. Sally utilizes four Weigl show controllers that run all of the show elements, including the preshow and load area monitors.
Oceaneering’s ride control system monitors the exact position of each ride vehicle. It communicates that information to both Sally’s show control system, which triggers show elements, and Alterface’s gaming control system, which initiates and monitors game play. Media for the attraction’s six projection screens is played back from the Alterface
servers.
Both attractions have received impressive reviews from fans in St. Louis and Texas. And according to John Wood, it’s only the beginning of a dark ride renaissance.
“There are a lot of things contributing to the resurgence of dark rides today,” says Wood. “Technology is one of those things, but it’s also time. There is an increase in demand worldwide that wasn’t there in past
decades.”
Six Flags CEO Jim Reid-Anderson seems to agree. At the IAAPA Asian Attractions Expo Leadership Breakfast, when asked about the success of the attraction, he hinted that more are in the pipeline: “[Interactive dark rides] are probably a fundamental part of our plan going forward.”

Abstract
The narrow interaction of the keyboard and traditional pointing devices keeps the digital world locked to a desk or palm top, preventing it from fully realizing its potential as a powerful medium of interaction and expression. This talk will describe the work in the Responsive Environments Group at the MIT Media Lab, where the development of new user interface devices for interactive spaces and multimodal, dexterous expression, aims to eliminate this barrier. Current and evolving projects will be described that detect user gesture by exploiting a variety of evolving sensor technologies. Many novel applications of these approaches will be demonstrated, including new musical instruments, interactive musical/graphical spaces, smart rooms, smart furniture, and sensing for wearable computer systems.What is Love?

Filed under INSPIRATIONAL QUOTES
An age old question. But perhaps these quotes from Rumi, a 12th century mystic, get it right.
Love is from the infinite and will remain until Eternity.
Love cannot be described. It must be tasted.
It is love that holds everything together. And it is the everything also.
I have died many times but your breath made me alive again.
Close the language door and use the love window. The moon won’t use the door, only the window.
love is all around us.
A thousand half-loves must be forsaken to take one whole heart home.
Love rests on no foundation. It is an endless ocean, with no beginning or end.
I was you and never knew it.
This is love: to fly toward a secret sky,
to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment.
First, to let go of life.
In the end, to take a step without feet.2018 Acura TLX A-Spec

Prices include $950 destination charge in the United States and $2,145 for freight, PDI, and A/C tax in Canada and, because of cross-border equipment differences, can’t be directly compared. Accord, a veritable wooly mammoth.
It can’t be helped. Acura knows the new 10th-generation Accord offers features unavailable in the Acura lineup. The TLX, meanwhile, features an interior that’s more than a little reminiscent of the ninth-generation Accord’s cabin. Fonts, buttons, switches, two-screen format — the upmarket/downmarket connections are too obvious to be dismissed as simply the mandatory parts-bin sharing of a global automaker with justifiable cost concerns. The new 2018 Acura TLX and the old Honda Accord are remarkably similar cars.
But is that so bad? The Honda Accord is, with good reason, consistently one of America’s most popular sedans, and the refreshed 2018 Acura TLX is a particularly nice interpretation of that car. Besides which, the Acura TLX isn’t just an Accord. It’s not merely an Accord. The TLX’s more powerful V6, a nine-speed automatic, and a very effective all-wheel-drive system make sure of that.
True, the elephant hasn’t exited the premises. But now that it’s standing out in the hallway, we can judge the 2018 Acura TLX V6 SH-AWD A-Spec on merit, rather than simply distinguishing the degree to which the TLX is or is not a Honda.
For just another moment, let that elephant alert us to the size of his, umm, trunk. See, despite virtually identical dimensions, the outgoing Honda Accord (of which thousands remain on dealer lots across America) offers four extra inches of rear legroom, an extra inch of rear shoulder room, 8 percent more passenger volume, and more than an extra cubic foot of cargo capacity.
Forget the Accord: the Acura TLX is by any standard a large car that doesn’t feel like a large car inside. Though undeniably easier to get in and out of than the Lexus IS350 we tested a week ago, the 2018 TLX doesn’t reveal itself as a car with notable space advantages when compared to the Lexus, a sedan that’s eight inches shorter than the Acura, bumper to bumper.
So if the TLX doesn’t gain an advantage over its smaller sports sedan brethren in terms of space efficiency, does it make headway in the athletics department?
Power
Among Acura’s updates for the 2018 TLX, powertrain changes are notably absent. The optional 3.5-liter V6 — an upgrade from the standard 206-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder/eight-speed DCT combo — still produces 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque and is still linked to a nine-speed automatic that’s happiest in sportier drive modes and under heavier throttle inputs.
Admittedly quick when caned, the TLX’s 3.5-liter is a distinctly naturally aspirated unit, an engine that needs to rev, an engine that likes to rev and sounds great when doing so. Yet customers increasingly acquainted with low-rpm turbo punch aren’t going to quickly take a liking to the TLX’s off-the-line recalcitrance. There’s enough weight in a top-spec TLX, 3,838 pounds, to slightly degrade the impact of the TLX’s heady horsepower numbers.
Indeed, there’s a persistent sense of mass when piloting the 2018 TLX V6 SH-AWD, a factor that stands in the way of Acura’s midsize sedan feeling truly nimble. Fortunately, under pressure, the TLX displays a pleasant dearth of body roll, steering that weights up nicely, minimal need for mid-corner correction, and an ability to put power down before, during, and when exiting a bend that mainstream sedan owners can only dream of.
Although the 2018 TLX lacks the final degrees of bite that would make it a true sports sedan — and on Michelin Primacy MXM4s, it lacks the necessary rubber, too — there are benefits reaped from Acura’s compromises. Ride quality remains ideal even on the A-Spec’s 19-inch rims: firm enough to never be floaty, soft enough to isolate brutal pavement. Observed fuel economy of 23 miles per gallon easily topped the Lexus IS350’s 19-mpg result. The nine-speed transmission, meanwhile, was reprogrammed for 2018 and now allows the TLX to settle into a serene and mature groove that does a fair job of squeezing the TLX V6 SH-AWD A-Spec onto a bridge that spans the Lexus IS350/ES350 gap.
Poshness
Alas, there’s no getting around the fact that at this lofty $45,750 as-tested price point, the 2018 Acura TLX lacks the desired cues of a luxury car. Besides the aforementioned Honda connections, of which there are too many to count, the TLX cabin offers nothing to wow, nothing to remind you of the money you’ve spent, nothing that shouts, “I’m special!”
The Audi A4 has its Virtual Cockpit gauge cluster. Mercedes-Benz’s C-Class, besides a tacked-on faux iPad, has the kind of interior design and materials that make it worthy of an E-Class price tag. Last week, the seats in the Lexus IS350 hugged so tight you had to know something must be up.
The Acura TLX’s interior, loaded up with all the equipment Acura can throw at it, leaves the impression normally left by a feature-laden and slightly cramped version of a conventional midsize family sedan.
Popular
Yet a quick, naturally aspirated, relatively affordable and unpretentious family sedan is evidently what many consumers are looking for. The TLX is America’s eighth-best-selling premium brand car, selling more often than the Audi A4, Lincoln MKZ, and Lexus IS, among many others.
In fact, Acura believes this MY2018 refresh will prove sufficient to drive TLX sales to the highest levels seen so far.
On what grounds? The 2015-2017 TLX, tasked with replacing the TSX and TL, was a wallflower. “Shoppers who rejected TLX,” Acura spokesperson Matt Sloustcher told TTAC, “often did so on the basis of the design not being aggressive enough for a sport sedan.”
If the TLX sold in decent numbers when it was scarcely noticeable, Acura figures, the wide-grilled 2018 TLX will surely attract more attention.
Price
Of course, price remains a leading factor across much of the TLX range, if not this specific tester.. At that price point, a basic Mercedes-Benz CLA250 is embarrassed. We won’t truly know how a $33,950 2018 TLX stacks up, of course, until we’ve tested a 2018 Honda Accord.
You can’t keep an elephant that large out of any room.

Improving the overall appearance of your skin is our goal. Cosmetic surgery isn’t the only route to facial and body rejuvenation. With the right combination of our cosmetic services and high quality skin care, you can achieve and maintain a younger, more refreshed look, and the confidence that comes with it.
Cleansing Treatment (Face, Chest and Back
Cleansing treatments are used to help with acne related issues on the face, chest, and/or back. The skin is cleansed to help exfoliate the dead cells and extractions are performed to unclog pores which are prone to breakouts. For added efficiency, a chemical peel can be added during this treatment.
Microderm (Face, Neck, Chest, Hands, Feet, Back
Skin exfoliation and micro-resurfacing removes dead skin cells. When applicable and in most cases, this treatment will also help to diminish fine lines, wrinkles, and shallow acne scars. Excellent addition to any facial or cleansing treatment.
Hydration Treatment
Rejuvenating and refreshing facial treatment to moisturize and hydrate dry skin, which can be caused by environmental conditions or prior facial treatments such as chemical peels or laser treatments.
Cosmetic Consultation
A free cosmetic consult with one of our providers is a great way to discuss any of our in-office treatments or products that can help you with your daily skin regimen. Discussion of fillers, injectables, lasers, facials, etc., are just a few treatments that can be reviewed with our staff.
Dermaplaning
Using a scalpel and a delicate touch, the provider abrades the surface of the skin using light, feathering strokes. This is a good alternative for pregnant women who want an exfoliation treatment, but who do not want to risk introducing chemicals to their body during pregnancy. It is also a first choice for patients who have excess vellus hair (peach fuzz), commonly found on the face. This hair often causes a buildup of dirt and oils in the follicles, so removing the hair gives the patient healthier looking skin.

Community banks were created to: (1) promote rural development through provision of banking and financial services, (2) enhance rural productive activities, and (3) improve economic status of small-scale producers in rural and urban areas. According to Marx (2004), Nigeria has a dynamic informal financial sector. A key to growth strategy is to assist the development of this informal sector. The recent government policy to rid the economy of community banks defeats the original purpose underlying the creation of community banks. In view of the important role of community banks in Nigeria, the authors propose that community banks should continue to be rural financial institutions with specialized methods to serve broad segments of the rural population. The National Board for Community Banks should be vested with power to license, monitor and regulate community banks, and the regulatory power of the Central Bank of Nigeria over community banks should not go beyond that necessary for the performance of its monetary policy function. Furthermore, a partnership should be formed between the National Board for Community Banks, National Association of Community Banks and the Nigeria Agricultural, Cooperative and Rural Development Bank for the purpose of funding rural ventures through loan syndication. The Bankers’ Committee initiative for small and medium enterprises funding should be channeled through the Nigeria Agricultural, Cooperative and Rural Development Bank.“The only measure of your words and your deeds / Will be the love you leave behind when you’re done.” Lyrics to the song “Everything Possible,” by Fred Small
The reciprocating image that we find in a mirror is unique kind of image. There is a cycle of return which always puts us back into the image we create.. But mirrored image is also a compensating image — one that holds us accountable for our response and its impact. There is a cycle of return that always puts us back into the image we create.
In my earlier discussion, I endeavored to look at five qualities of conscience: reciprocity, social veracity, safety, diversity, and empathy. These qualities are as close as we can humanly get to the perfection of the mirror’s reciprocating image. They are also the points of compensation which measure and reflect back to us the impact of our response.
- If I do not extend reciprocity, then the mirrored image will not offer me empathy in return.
- If I do not respect social veracity, then the mirrored image will not offer me safety in return.
- If I do not extend safety, then the mirrored image will not not honor my needs or the needs of those I love.
- If I do not respect the diversity of needs, the image will not offer empathy in return.
In simplest terms, if I refuse to honor the most important dimensions of relationship, then karmic debt is created. And I am always immersed in relationship; so the debt I create in one relationship will eventually be paid back through some other relationship. There is both a sense of deep democracy and deep justice in this creation of karmic debt.
- Deep democracy listens to all voices. It offers respect for how we extend reciprocity, social veracity, safety, diversity, and empathy to one another. Everyone is included. Everyone counts.
- Deep justice exacts a compensation for when voices are not heard. It offers a karmic response to present reality of relationship. Debts are created that must be acknowledged and paid — just so relationship can flourish again.
Let’s look at examples of karmic debts created by relationship toxins of criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling.
- Criticism – Classified as an over generalized attack against the personality and character of an person or group around minor or incidental “flaws,” criticism only seeks to belittle or diminish. It attacks safety by withdrawing empathy; the resulting imbalance diminishes reciprocity, social veracity, and diversity.
- Contempt – Classified as the intent to insult and psychologically abuse an person or group with no reference to any observable behavior, contempt only seeks to destroy the integrity and identity of another. It attacks reciprocity denying any impact for one’s action; the resulting imbalance diminishes safety, social veracity, and diversity.
- Defensiveness – Classified as the protective withdrawal into aggressive forms of rigidity that “act out” shame, blame and denial, defensiveness only seeks to destroy the openness required for communication. It attacks diversity by enforcing personal veracity; the resulting imbalance diminishes reciprocity, safety and empathy.
- Stonewalling – Classified as the withdrawal of all thoughts, feelings and actions on behalf of the relationship, stonewalling only seeks to create the impact that has already been realized on one side of the relationship. It inverts empathy through passivity and destroys reciprocity; the resulting imbalance diminishes safety, social veracity, and diversity.
The karmic debts created by any of these behaviors will most likely be repaid through some kind of relationship pain as the conscience tries to clear itself of the debt. The best way to avoid unnecessary pain is to conscientiously uphold all five qualities which are the basis for just and right relationship. While mental illness may alter the way conscience records relationship debt, the thoughts outlined above (I believe) apply to healthy, well-functioning adults.
As Fred Small pointed out: “The only measure of your words and your deeds / Will be the love you leave behind when you’re done.” Love is the principle results created by right relationship. Conscience seeks after love in all of its contemplation.

Alexa is usually behind 2 or 3 days in displaying stats but now from May 19th it is not updated, what is happening?
Technorati has s different problem, it looks like it is not reliable anymore for rankings. See the two screenshots taken at the same time, both of them show different rank for the same site, i noticed this few days back and thought its a temporary issue but looks like it is not. It is useless to contact Technorati they don’t respond and bother about users.
I used to check Technorati once in a while when I started blogging.
Not any more. IMHO, The site has lost its charm.
I’m surprised also about Alexa, but Technorati has been dead for a long time.
I agree with Shankar, Technorati is not any more a big site.
Alexa has not updated for long time now…
Technorati is really freak now. I also don’t believe stats on Alexa because because Alexa shows itself 0 and no-ranking. How funny!
To me they are dead. Technorati has gone crazy and is horribly unreliable, and Alexa is outright wrong. Use Quantcast instead – 100% accurate once you put the tracker on your site. The rank on Quantcast for my new site TomatoGames is 90,000 or so, on Alexa it’s 475,000+ …..
Even i haven’t checked Technorati since long time. Ever since Alexa has changed there ranking algo, they take a long time to make an update.
Its all a conspiracy. Page Rank was what we told our clients as important and then all of a sudden sites its not as important. Then its Alexa and so on. Its a continuous battle teaching then un teaching our clients. It makes us look like we don’t know.

Pay the tropics to reverse deforestation
Australian conservationist William Lawrence says there’s an easy way to stop the razing of the rainforests..
If we hope to reign in global warming, the last thing we should be doing is razing tropical forests. Destroying them dumps vast quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere – nearly 20 per cent of all human carbon emissions, which is more than the entire global transportation sector.
More than that, tropical forests, which emit water vapour into the atmosphere, are major drivers of cloud formation. Clouds cool the planet by reflecting solar heat back into space, and they also sustain regional rainfall, which limits destructive forest fires. Hence, saving a hectare of tropical forest does far more to reduce global warming than saving a hectare of other types of forest.
IN RECENT YEARS, MANY scientists have advocated carbon trading as a way to slow tropical deforestation. Known as ‘REDD’ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation), the idea under Kyoto) or that produce fewer emissions than allowed. Like any tradable commodity, the price of carbon credits is largely determined by supply and demand.
In theory, everyone should win with REDD. Wealthier nations, such as Australia, can pay to help slow deforestation as part of an overall effort to meet their emissions target. Protecting an imperilled forest in Madagascar, for instance, might lead to the same net reduction of carbon emissions – and be far cheaper – than retrofitting a coal-fired generating plant here or in the US.
In a transaction like this, dangerous carbon emissions are reduced, a biologically rich forest is protected and Madagascar gains direly needed foreign revenues. In any effort to slow global warming, tropical forests are the low-hanging fruit.
IF REDD IS SUCH A GREAT idea, why hasn’t it been implemented already? The first effort to install it, as part of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, met with surprisingly intense opposition. European green groups feared that wealthy nations like the US would simply buy their way out of their international obligations to permanently cut their burgeoning emissions.
Others argued that forest conservation was a risky and uncertain strategy for battling greenhouse gases. For example, even though you might try to slow deforestation by establishing a new national park in Malaysia, ‘leakage’ could occur if slash-and-burn farmers simply move to other areas and continue destroying the forest.
Finally, Brazil, which alone contains a third of the world’s tropical forest, adamantly opposed REDD and lobbied other developing nations to do likewise. Brazil feared that long-term commitments to protect forests could potentially limit their future development options.
Fortunately, the situation changed dramatically at the Bali climate conference in 2007, with REDD finally getting a green light. A coalition of small, forest-rich countries, led by Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica, made great strides, skilfully negotiating to avoid some of the biggest concerns about REDD.
Those worried about the ‘leakage’ realised, failing to address tropical deforestation was dangerously irresponsible.
REDD IS NOW MOVING forward, but technical hurdles remain. For a developing nation to qualify for carbon credits, it must first establish its baseline rate of carbon emissions from deforestation, and then show that is has reduced emissions below that. This requires good data on current and past rates of forest loss, as well as field inventories to estimate how much carbon is stored in its forests. Satellites are increasingly being used to generate these numbers, but much work remains to get reliable estimates for all developing nations.
While REDD could be a boon for forests, it also raises important policy questions. For instance, while rapidly deforesting nations such as Brazil and Indonesia could benefit greatly from carbon trading, how do you reward an environmental leader like Costa Rica, which is actually gaining forest cover? Under the current scheme, Costa Rica would gain nothing, because its baseline deforestation rate is zero.
Furthermore, will REDD effectively protect endangered biodiversity? Purely from a global warming perspective, the most efficient way to reduce greenhouse gases is to focus on big countries such as Brazil and Indonesia, which account for the lion’s share of deforestation. But the most imperilled species persist in tiny forest remnants in nations such as Madagascar, the Philippines, and the Brazilian Atlantic forests. Protecting these scraps of forest would do little to slow global warming, though some donors might be willing to pay a premium price for carbon credits in these hotspots of biodiversity.
REDD is becoming a reality, with some US$6 billion now having been committed for various schemes globally. Many challenges remain, however, and care will be needed to ensure that initiatives are not swamped by technical obstacles or national self-interest.
In my view, perhaps the greatest challenge for REDD is the prospect of a massive expansion of biofuels. Be it sugarcane, oil palm, soy, or jatropha trees, the tropics is the best place to grow biofuel crops, and the escalating demand for biofuels is creating an enormous incentive for converting tropical forests to farmland.
This will drive up land prices and thereby reduce the attractiveness of REDD, and the massive carbon emissions from forest destruction could reverse any gains from REDD initiatives. As enlightened citizens, let us demand both sustainable energy and forest policies from our government.

so there is great care that needs to be taking when cleaning. This is something
that should be done by an adult to ensure that no damage is done.
I must say that your bow should always be wiped clean after every use.
This will help prevent resin and dirt from building up, which will cause damage
to the strings on your violin.
To clean your bow, you should use ethyl or a wood alcohol. Along with the
wood alcohol, you need to use a soft cloth or a paper towel. I would like to
mention that these supplies can be found at your local hardware store. This is
much cheaper than an instrumental store. I want to tell you, from a bad
experience, to NEVER, NEVER, NEVER use rubbing alcohol. This will damage your
violin bow and the hair on it.
When cleaning the hair on your bow, use your wood alcohol and an old
toothbrush. Dip the toothbrush in the alcohol and gently brush the bow hair
lengthwise. This will remove the dirt and extra rosin. Let the hair dry for
three to four hours. Next, attach it to the bow and remember to apply rosin to
your bow after cleaning.
Keep in mind, regular maintenance and cleaning will keep your violin in
great shape. This will help the violin to last longer and the sound to remain
consistent.

Hit points, armor class, weapons, everything. It took almost literally no time at all, thanks to one of the least controversial and handy house rules I ever forget that I have:
I call it the "Ten Items or Less" Rule. See, you can get basic items and armor for free (that's up to light armor and any one-handed item) for free, because they're practically free anyways and I'm not really picky. I don't require dynamic encumbrance counts, for one. Math at the table should be limited to figuring out one's hit rolls by subtracting THACO from the die roll, or by figuring out how much gold goes where at the end of an adventure.
But for two, you get ten items from the equipment table for free. You can have a bedroll, two torches, waterskin (water), flask(rum), two 50' ropes, tent, blanket, and 10' pole. Or you could have a hammer, 50' rope, waterskin (water), two blankets, three days of rations, a bedroll, and a tent. For free. Seriously, don't even count them, it doesn't matter. I'm not looking over your math anyways, just take ten items, stick them in a backpack, and spend your gold on weapons, armor, ammunition, that sort of thing. When you're done, though, all your gold is gone. Instead of keeping it, you get 1d6x10 silver. That's 10-60, roughly a month's wages for a skilled laborer.
See, this rule does a couple of things. Firstly, it means that players aren't agonizing over whether to spend their 5 silver on ropes at character creation. There are more interesting times to worry about gold, and that's at the table, not when we're trying to figure out who's bringing what and how. Second, it's essentially a starting package for you- you have some odds and ends, and it encourages creativity. So you've already got food, water, shelter, and light. You've got another item to bring. Should you bring parchment? What about a quill? Will we need pitons? That sort of thing.
And lastly, it means that characters start out kind of poor. You know, the driving motivation behind half of what Conan does (the other half being revenge), and all of what people do in Theives' World. It's the simplest, and easiest motivation in the world. If a night in an inn costs 1 gold, and you currently have roughly 1/6th of one gold peice, you're going to need to make back the investment you guys just now made into all of that shiny armor and weapons and stuff. Hey, night's falling. You'd better get moving, the town guard doesn't take kindly to vagrants.
All of these things are good things. You still have to spend money outside of character creation, of course, so that the rope and pitons and stuff you brought will be more expensive next time. With any luck, of course, you'll be coming back to town with 500-600 gold, so maybe it'll be time to upgrade that plate armor for once, and then spend time in town recuperating and training and all that. Without any luck, you'll come back into town broke and half dead, with the blood of henchmen on your boots, but that's neither here nor there. Come back with your shield or on it, as they say!Main Content Document - Act 300 of 1949 300 of 1949 MICHIGAN VEHICLE CODE (257.1 - 257.923)***** 257.719 SUBSECTIONS (2)(a) AND (3)(b) MAY NOT APPLY: See subsection (9) ***** ***** 257.13e.added THIS ADDED SECTION IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 28, 2018 ***** ***** 257.32b THIS SECTION IS AMENDED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 28, 2018: See 257.32b.amended ***** 3.1 MB 1.7 MB Download Time for 56K Modem 7.7 minutes 4.3 minutes Download Time for Broadband 30.4 seconds 16.9 secondsAs a small business owner, chances are that the safety and security of your pharmacy’s patients and employees are among your top priorities.
When you have open positions to fill, it’s easy to rely on resumes and ‘gut instinct’ to make quick hiring decisions. But not so fast! It’s important to implement a robust employee screening program to help mitigate your security risk and protect your pharmacy, your patients and your staff.
Why screen prospective and current employees?
By properly screening of job applicants and employees, you can:
- Help ensure that your pharmacy staff is of the best possible quality;
- Minimize the risk of employing personnel with a propensity for criminal activity or substance abuse;
- Reduce the risk of that you’ll employ someone under federal government sanctions—which could put at risk your ability to accept, or receive payment for, Medicare-related business.
What’s included in an employee screening?
The above-listed risks can be minimized by following a two-step employee screening process, consisting of (1) a criminal background check and (2) a drug test.
Background checks are governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) which, among other things, regulates Credit Reporting Agencies (CRAs). You can conduct a criminal background check by working with a credit reporting agency—a good one can help you navigate the intricacies of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
Employee screening can be divided into pre-employment, and post-hire. What follows are some steps you can take to help you hire, and maintain, better employees.
Pre-employment screening
There’s no need to screen every job applicant—only screen applicants after you extend an offer of employment. Actual hiring should be contingent upon successful completion of the screen.
For the criminal background check, consider having your credit reporting agency perform the following checks. Although it’s possible to select only a few items from this list, we generally recommend ordering the most comprehensive search possible. This approach will provide you with the most protection and peace of mind:
- Criminal Felony and Misdemeanor Check
- Education Report
- Employment Verification Check
- Federal Criminal Check
- Healthcare Sanctions Check
- National Criminal Database Search
- SSN Trace and validation
Applicants for positions requiring driving a motor vehicle should also undergo a Motor Vehicle Record (MVR) check. Again, your credit reporting agency will be able to perform this check for you.
For the drug test, Cardinal Health recommends our retail pharmacy customers use a hair drug test. Although a bit more expensive than urine tests, hair tests are extremely difficult to defeat, and are thus more effective in helping to ensure your applicants are drug-free. However, hair drug tests are not permitted in Hawaii, Iowa, and Puerto Rico; if you are in one of these states, require a urine drug test instead.
Post-hire screening
Consider performing periodic criminal background checks (every two years is a reasonable interval) on all of your employees. This will ensure that you always have more current information, avoiding reliance on criminal background checks that are several years old.
It’s generally a best practice to perform random drug tests on all of your employees, state law permitting. Requiring these at least every six months, especially with hair tests, will serve as a deterrent against illegal drug use, lets your employees know that you will not tolerate illegal drug use and will help minimize employees’ temptation to divert controlled substances.
Decide in advance what the consequences of a positive drug test will be. Will you terminate the employee or will you give him or her a second chance? If a second chance, will you ask the employee to seek professional counseling for a substance abuse problem?
Also, become familiar with procedures for reasonable suspicion substance testing. Reasonable suspicion refers to circumstances where a business owner suspects an employee is impaired, and would require him or her to submit to a drug and/or alcohol test.
Finally, if you suspect one of your employees of alcohol-induced impairment, be prepared to require a Breath Alcohol Test (BAT, also known as breathalyzer). Because the human body metabolizes alcohol quickly, don’t wait until such a situation arises to decide how you will handle it, and where and how you will send the employee for a breath alcohol test.
Follow these best practices before you hire new employees to join your pharmacy team, and make sure your employees know that you’ll continue to perform these screenings to protect the safety of your pharmacy, your patients and your employees. Taking these precautionary steps can help mitigate security risks and give you the peace of mind of knowing that your pharmacy is staffed by employees you—and your patients—can trust.
*The information provided should be considered as precautionary, and does not warrant or represent that by implementing such measures, your business will be free from any and all security risk or damages.Blood Sugar Levels help Brings about of substantial blood sugar should certainly be averted at all costs.

Unfortunately not all of it is good. Being in a wheelchair anywhere is difficult; arriving in Paris took it to a whole new level. You would expect a major city like Paris to be reasonably configured for wheelchairs. Alas, in the main it is not. This is not a real surprise; after all, Paris is filled with Parisians, a people known for their general attitude about anything or anyone not quite up to their view of who should be what.
Paris began with our arrival in the Gare du Nord after a terrific trip via the Eurostar from London through the Channel Tunnel, aka the Chunnel. The trip across takes about two hours plus a time zone change. England is on England time; France is on European time. So leaving at noon gets you into Paris at 3:15 local time. The crew in St. Pancras station in London got me and my wheelchair on board efficiently and we had great seats for the ride. There was even a light lunch and some wine, rather like the airline flights of old; not a one of the airlines would deign to serve food to coach class passengers on a two hour trip these days.
When we got to Paris, there appeared to be nobody to unload those of us in wheelchairs; there were three of us in three consecutive cars. The station agent tried to operate the lift that gets wheelchairs on and off in Paris; it was clearly not something he did often. Nonetheless, he tried until about 20 minutes after arrival the person who normally did the job finally showed up. We managed to get off and out to the taxi line.
When I got to the taxi line they put my right in the front of the line and called up a taxi, a standard taxi. I looked at the taxi drive and he looked at my wheelchair, asking me to get up an sit in the car. I said I could not, so this rather nice fellow went down the line of taxis to see if he could find a wheelchair taxi. I asked the taxi stand agent if there was a handicapped taxi to which he replied that there were none like that in Paris.
Of course I knew this to be untrue. The reality was that the taxi stand operator couldn't be bothered to get me a wheelchair taxi; he had a line up full of "normal" people demanding whatever cab they could get. We finally gave up and got out my transfer board from my suitcase; it was a good thing to have with me at this point. I set up the chair and board and, not without some risk and a lot of difficulty, transferred to the back seat of the car. Then, after loading the luggage, it was off to our hotel.
I asked the front desk clerk at the hotel about wheelchair transportation in Paris. She tells me there are wheelchair cabs, but not many. The buses are mostly wheelchair adapted however the Metro has absolutely no wheelchair access. We knew this would happen on the trip, but in Paris?
Parisians think their city is so wonderful they do not need to accommodate any one's special needs, they are totally inconsiderate. Good luck there . Love Mom
The Metro #14 line from Olympiads to Gare St Lazare is 100% wheelchair friendly. However, elevators do sometimes go out of order and you may find yourself having to go to the next stop.
I found the best way to get around Paris is to use the buses and like in London. Hotel location is important. Where did you end up staying?
I stayed near Olympiads which had the accessible metro line as well as a good selection of bus routes to all the major locations. The area wasn't quite as "quaint" but it was easy and economical.
I did London - Paris - Frankfurt (and the Rhine) - Amsterdam about 5 years ago. London was the best for accessibility; Paris probably was the worst.
We are at the Mercure next to the Gare de Lyon. It is an excellent hotel with great wheelchair access. The staff has been terrific.Li & Fung, the HK-based trading firm that supplies western fashion chains like Gap, has been dropped from oh-so-cool Wired magazine's Wired 40
hip list of companies. Its fault, apparently, is to stick to its
knitting. “With China making the leap to exporting computers and cars,
T-shirts are unimpressive,” yawns Wired.
EngagingChina begs to differ. Despite the noise
coming from the Shanghai car show this week, it will be many years
before China's car industry makes an impact outside of its admittedly
huge domestic market.
In the computer industry, China's only world-class player, Lenovo, is hardly a great example of export-driven success. EngagingChina
will be interviewing Bill Amelio, president and CEO of Lenovo, tomorrow
so we will run a dedicated a story on the world's third largest PC
maker later this week.
Just to bring readers up to speed, Lenovo bought IBM's loss-making
PC division in 2004 in a bid to project the company onto the world
stage. But the jury is still out on the wisdom of the deal. The company
remains heavily dependent on China where it gets around 40% of its
revenues. In the strategically-important US market, Lenovo's shipments
dropped 4% in the latest quarter.
And the task of turning around the IBM business is taking a long time — another round of job losses was announced last week.
Wired drools about how Lenovo, which does make the Wired 40, is
leveraging “low-cost Chinese R&D into cool features like laptops
secured by facial recognition.” But laptops are commodity items these
days and Lenovo recognises its business biggest challenges lie less in
inventing cool technology and more in strengthening its supply chain
and streamlining channels to market.
These latter areas are where Li & Fung truly excels and the
reason why the HK firm has been so successful at linking hundreds of
factories in India and Asia with major customers like Gap and the
Limited in the west.
Once a simple trading outfit, Li & Fung is now riding the
globalisation trend to stunning effect, both to find customers and
source goods. The share of goods sourced from China is reducing in
favour of cheaper countries and is now 46%. Li & Fung reported its
results this week and impressive reading they make.
In 2006, turnover rose
22% to 8.7bn — it has tripled in the past ten years — and it is well
on track to reach $10bn by the end of this year. Profits rose by a
similar amount. Admittedly, two thirds of the growth comes from
acquisitions but the rest is from organic growth.
In recent months, Li & Fung has acquired the sourcing arm of
German department-store giant KarstadtQuelle and the global sourcing
operations of Tommy Hilfinger. The latter deal, unveiled last month, is
an example of the growing trend for “extreme outsourcing” whereby
retailers seek to realise cost savings by entrusting their global
supply chains to specialist operators.
While little known to the wider world, Li & Fung has become a
text-book example in using the supply chain and information technology
as a competitive weapon.
More on Li & Fung in this Forbes story and this Financial Times article.
April 28th, 2007 on 8:32 pm
Li & Fung is hip and it is the future. They get it. They really do.
May 14th, 2007 on 9:06 am
Just goes to show how tired Wired is these days.
June 12th, 2007 on 8:43 pm
Your argument seems really valid to me and I totally agree with that. What's more, the Li & Fung not only has become a master in supply chain intermediation for large retailers such as Gap Inc., Reebok and Walmart but also, through establishing its online subsidiary lifung.com since 2001, has been offering the same range of services to small ad mid-size firms.
Given the resulting complexity of the orders at the back-end of the supply chain, only few companies can do what this Hong Kong based company is doing.
By the way, I recently found your website. I have added your manufacturing section's link to and will definitely follow your future writings.

A lot of people out there are probably thinking about the cool social networking website by Mark Zuckerburg that has pretty much taken over the world.
So what people want to know is Does Facebook Charge any money to use their services?
The answer is NO. Facebook is entirely free and they generate revenue from having ads displayed that fit your demographics and profile information that are charged either on a per click or per impression basis. So if you say that you are a male 35 who likes to snowboard in Colorado than you might see an ad for outdoor world and play it again sports advertising snow boards on your page when you are browsing around facebook.
With over 400 million accounts (note that many users have multiple accounts and pages for their businesses so the 400 million user number that is often quoted is probably off) they are able to currently generate over a billion dollars in expected earnings revenue this year making 2010 the best year ever for the popular social networking website.
Facebook however has a very high over head cost in just it's server fees alone. Which were recently released at over $100 million dollars a year to handle all of the traffic, bandwith, pictures, videos, etc....
With an IPO (initial public offering) of Facebook.com it will instantly make the owner's very wealthy and may open up the possibility of expanding revenues with a model that charges per month or per year. If it was $4.95 a month I am sure that a lot of users would still be willing to pay since the face book addiction is rather large.More knits

$2.00 Shipping & Handling fees collected
Gross profit = $6.97
Net profit = $.04 (woot woot, haha!!)
So what I do is, I head to McDonald's now and then and "treat" the kids to lunch. Depending on how cool the kids think the current Happy Meal campaign is, I might let them keep one toy per campaign and I sell the rest. For example, Star Wars, Matchbox cars, Barbi and My Little Pony are keepers. Any trips after that, I keep the toys to sell. Who needs that many tiny toys anyway?
I keep them new in the plastic and sell them on eBay. Who buys these McDonald's toys? I've seen adult collectors purchase them and moms who had a little one lose their favorite one. As far as eBay is concerned, you just never know what people sre searching for! I also recently sold 19 Happy Meal toys to someone in Japan, that was about $95 in cash deposit into my PayPal. Not to mention he bought a few outfits from my store as as well. I could, think of them as profit making ($.04) advertising. :)
My point is, find little things you can do but keep it fun. I'd say it takes me about 10 minutes to sell each toy. That's from start (taking pictures & listing) to finish (pulling from storage & shipping). I don't list them until I have 5 or 6 to list, and use "list similar" to make listing faster. So 10 minutes of my time in invested for each $4 Happy Meal I buy. That's $24 an hour, but when I add in my Wylie Mom math, I'd need to earn $32 an hour outside of the home to have the same lunch experience. I personally find that reading a book while the kids play at McDonald's for a treat, and then spending a few minutes on the computer is a great use of my time.
McDonald's indoor playgrounds are a great idea for running off energy on rainy days or on days when you're running lots of errands. Please be sure to wash up or sanitize before and after play time!!
Figure what your time is worth and combine it with what you enjoy doing, to save or make money. Obviously, I can't make a living or survive with this plan, but it combined with all the other little things I do make a huge impact. You've just got to think outside of the box!
I'd love to hear some of your ideas!Step by step tutorial on how to draw a tree

May 15th, 2013 at 5:34 amOnly we know what true pain feels like! We deal with so much yet still manage to keep a smile on our face. Every month without fail we have the painters visiting, yes I'm talking about menstural cycle, periods! Obviously if you're on some form of contraception, unbalanced diet etc they will stop.
Periods are a pain and so you need to know ways that can help you ease the cramping pains.
As you know every individual will experience things in life different from others. And period pain varies from mild to significantly painful. One of the best ways to ease the cramping is by staying active. If you're not feeling for an adventurous walk, you might just want to walk to the shops for sweets.
It might not seem appropriate but dress up and put a bit of makeup on. Look good feel great! Plus I also read somewhere that women dress better when they're on their periods. If you're lucky you might get a few compliments which will boost up you confidence levels.
People say eat healthy and so you should but when you're on your periods you tend to crave sweet things more than usual. Have a few extra bites of everything.. After all you're bloody hungry. <crude joke alert.
Anything hot.. hot drink, warm bath, hot water bottle you need it.
A back massage from who ever.. just let them get on with it.
Medication might be a must, I try to stay away from them but when it's unbareable take a pain killer. Plus hormones are all over the place, so you might want to take a calms if you can't tolerate anyone around you either lool.
If pains are extremely unbareable consider going to your GP. You don't want periods to interfere with your daily life. Periods shouldn't stop you from going for a meal with friends. However, stay away from wearing white.Ada just sighed in her sleep. I swear to God, the heavens may as well have just opened up to choirs of angels singing, that's how beautiful something so small as her sigh is to me. I am the luckiest girl.
Where I work nobody has kids. Most don't want kids. The majority openly express their disdain for children. The greater percentage are stymied that
a.) I wanted a child
and
b.) don't regret a single moment of being her mother.
When I try to explain how and why I love Ada? Cricket....cricket...tumbleweed rolls by...and then the looks of shock and disgust set in. I end up defending myself briefly before giving up altogether.
Shoot, I didn't get it no matter how much anyone tried to explain it to me. I don't know why I think that I might offer some brilliant word combination that suddenly exposes the joy of parenthood to a non-believer. It's like serving borscht to guests (which I did 2 weeks ago); I probably shouldn't bother trying to introduce something so new and different.
Just the other day I was talking with a woman I work with:
"No, I'm not pregnant yet."
"Shit. My fertility dance didn't work." actually, it did but I miscarried that one.
"Not yet. I just ovulated though so maybe..."
"I'll dance on you again."
"Dude, that would be awesome."
One or two lurkers joined the conversation with something along the lines of, "Eeewww. Why would you want more kids?" The conversation took that turn and there I was trying to convince everyone that having a kid isn't that bad. In fact, I really, really like it - LOVE it even.
More looks of disbelief.
No, really.
Just like 98% of the people I work with, I used to say that I hated children. I used to say that I didn't want children. That might have been a slight over statement. It would have been more accurate to say that I didn't understand children. They scared the shit out of me but it was an unthinkable thing to admit. Instead, I tried to act all tough but just ended up sounding like an asshole. I didn't know how to talk to kids or what to do with them or how to hold them. Nothing. I wasn't born wanting to be a mother.
Then, one day, I just knew that I would be a mom.
Tim was right. When we decided to have children and get married (the decision we made was in exactly that order but the execution was in the opposite order. I didn't know I was such a traditionalist but when it came to tacks, I wanted my kids born into the benefit of marriage). He said, "I think that having kids is the next pathway to learning about yourself." At the time, I agreed with the statement and my heart raced at the magnitude of what we were discussing. It was exactly what I wanted and he had articulated it perfectly. I had no idea how extensive that learning would be or what we were getting in to but I was ready.
Then I had Ada. She changed my life in a way so thoroughly good that I truly can't imagine - don't want to imagine - my life without her. In an instant my primary role, the number one thing I would identify myself as for the rest of my life, had changed: she made me a mother. To think that I almost denied myself this massive love...love so pure and consuming it isn't earthly.
A few days after I gave birth, it was as if a light switch was turned on. I see my child in all other children. When they laugh, I hear her laughter. When they ask a question, I think of her curiosity. When they have a tantrum, I empathize with the parent(s) - it's tough when their frontal lobes shut off - and I just wait for the storm to blow over because eventually it will. I have to hold myself back from hugging and kissing children - even the children of good friends in case they think it's creepy that I'm so affectionate, which is borderline ridiculous since I love to watch my friends totally smother my kid with love!
Cue one of the vets leaning back in her chair, contorting her face, and asking, "Really?"
Yes, really. My only regret about having children is that I started so damn late. I'd have a dozen if I could.

jumping over from PYHO ...
I get what you're saying. I have always loved children, but there were so many things I wanted to accomplish, that I didn't see the time for it (couple that with the doctor that tried to scare me into eating with the comment "you've depleted your body of so much that you will never have children" and you get the shocked 17 year old in total denial of a life form growing inside)
today? even the really crappy days leave me wishing for another little human to hold. of course I mean REALLY little - like they can't talk back yet, little. ;)
It would be hard to be surrounded by people who just don't get it.
This parenting thing? Best decision of my life.
I still don't completely comprehend, as I do not yet have a child outside of my body, but I am looking forward to learning all about it! Thinking of you! xoxoxo
Being a mother is the best decision I ever made. As much as I try to not judge, I don't understand how a person could not want kids.
I always disliked most kids but always knew I'd be a mom. Maybe it was that "next step in discovering yourself" impulse that you speak of or maybe it was something I wanted to do because it's part of the human experience, I don't know.
I can't say that love for my boy has led me to see him in every child, but it has made me see myself in every parent. Make sense?
I was there, too. I didn't think I'd ever be a mom, didn't get it, played all the cool kid games. I had coworkers who LOVED parenthood, though, and tried to explain it. I never understood until I met the right person and had one myself.
Interestingly, I worked in video games, and the people trying to convince me how great it was were tattooed, "alternative" 25-year-old game designer males.
i didn't always want to have kids but that was because of what i wen thru as one... then my siblings had kids and i couldn't get enough of their.. purity. and then i knew i HAD to become a mom. i think that's why i'm so enamored at being one now- because i knew i wanted one in my mid 20s, but didn't have one till my late 30s.
anyway, as always, BEAUTIFUL post. <3

Today, the Nurburgring is oh so very cold. It's not as though I wasn't warned – I came out of a meeting yesterday to a voicemail message from Alexa which noted that “it is freaking cold here” at least five times in about 30 seconds – but the cold still caught me by surprise when we walked past the building site outside and into the paddock.
This morning it felt as though the circuit had never hosted a summer.
“Man it's cold here,” Mark Glendenning noted at the coffee machine, showing the sort of insight that he is rightly famous for. “Isn't it supposed to be July now?” Mark is a fellow Australian who works for Autosport magazine: we've been mates since we worked together in another life, more years ago than we care to remember. “Yeah, but what I want to know is how I can get someone to drive me around the Nordschleife. You've done that, haven't you?” “Yeah, it's amazing, especially when it gets up through Karusel: go through there fast enough, and you may need some more underwear.” “I think we need to steal a driver to do a lap.” A quick scan of the room gave me the perfect victim: “Hey Filippi, we need you to drive us around the old circuit.” “Is it still open? I thought they closed it now.” “I think one of the German car companies rents the place for the weekend,” Mark suggested. “Damn, you don't have any links with them, do you?” “No, but I want to do it! Maybe I will just keep going at the end of race two!” “I don't think you want to do that: you'd do huge damage to the underside of your car. When Heidfeld did it in the F1 car last time they had to run it as high as physically possible.” “Ah, in that case maybe I'll just take Villa's car instead!”
The Nurburgring is a circuit the Italian loves, so you can see why he might want to stay on it for a bit longer, although given his luck here you can find an equal reason for wanting to get back to the pits and out of the way: after qualifying well he was nerfed out of the race at turn one last time by Sébastien Buemi, who came over to apologise only to get the talk to the hand treatment and the cutting, but not inaccurate, comment “you should go back to Formula 3”...
He's not the only one with bad luck here: the FMSI team were struggling after both cars were out in free practice, with Andi Zuber spinning at turn one and Luiz Razia having a big impact with the wall out of turn ten. Zuber tried to bluff his way through when I asked him what happened afterwards, but eventually he had to admit the truth.
“I've been doing one of those drifting courses in Germany this week, you know? I love doing that: it was so much fun. So anyway, I enjoyed it so much, and it's been in my head ever since, and when I was out there today I though 'I wonder if it's possible to drift a GP2 car?' So I thought I'll try it at turn one, the perfect place for it.
“It turns out, it's not...”
Razia was less fortunate than his teammate: although he got through the accident unharmed the same couldn't be said for his car, as the whole rear had to be replaced. His mechanics were immediately on the job, and they did an amazing job: working under incredibly tight time constraints and foregoing lunch they pushed hard to get the car rebuilt in time for qualifying, their arms and hands still a blur over the car as the rest of the field made their way out to the pitlane.
Eventually they finished, but as the session had already started they were unable to use the usual method to get on track, a small entrance gate just after the pit exit next to the medical facilities: needless to say race control were unable to allow them to pop out there on safety grounds. But cognisant of the hard work the boys had put in, an alternate route around the back of the F1 paddock was found, and the series organisers asked if it would be okay to allow them to make use of it, as it eventually worms around to the top end of the pitlane.
Happily they were given the okay, and a quick check to make sure the route was clear gave Luiz the chance to blast down the alley and make use of his mechanics handiwork. Andi made up for his previous blushes by pulling in sixth on the grid tomorrow, while Luiz will just be happy to line up on the grid for his first race here.
Meanwhile, Luca managed to blot his copybook on a very hot lap and spun to a halt at the chicane, throwing away a good grid position in the process. If I were the marshals here, I'd make sure there is something a little more than a few cones to block the way onto the old circuit tomorrow: given his grid position, the Italian may have his mind on other things than the race.
First comment! Woo!... Only comment? Sad!
Nice new design by the way
Haha, Andi is so funny
Liking the new look... didn't realise the first 'send' button is actually a 'preview' button though
Love the new layout!
lol at the drifting guy!
Also: doing a lap on the old circuit is amaaaazing, even in a roadcar.Investment in new marinas and staging key events are helping to put Turkey on the map when it comes to sailing.
The statistics are certainly surprising. Turkey is the third highest producer of luxury yachts in the world, and with an unspoilt coastline of 8,000km and 352 Blue Flag beaches, it’s easy to see why has become one of the coolest sailing destinations in the Mediterranean.
There is a tradition of regular international boat races and festivals throughout the year as well as the serene ‘Blue Cruise’ on a traditional wooden boats alongside a breathtaking coastline. There are lots of anchoring points which offer fantastic settings for swimming and diving, as well as secret bays, local fishing villages and modern resort towns to explore.
Recognizing the economic benefits Turkey has embarked on a new infrastructure program, new marinas are opening all the time – the latest plans include marinas for Dalaman on the Mediterranean coast, Oren on the Aegean coast (close to Bodrum and in Istanbul). In total Turkey has 36 international standard marinas and 12 municipality operated marinas with a total capacity of 14,230 floating berths and 5,605 hard standing.
At present.
Newly opened marinas include Cesme Marina and Teos Marina in Izmir, Didim Marina in Aydin, Kas Marina and Mersin Marina in Antalya, and West Istanbul Marina and Yalova Marina in Istanbul.
The country also hosts a variety of international festivals and regattas throughout the year, including the Bodrum Cup. A unique international yacht regatta and annual tradition, it celebrates the end of Turkey’s cruising season and unites Bodrum’s charter fleet with private wooden yachts from around the world. The exciting competition is held every October, and is exclusively for classically constructed wooden vessels, both for skilled yachtsmen and novices, who can stow away as passengers or join the crews for the last adventure of the sailing season. For more details visit.
Other festivals and regattas in Turkey include:
• International Yachting Festival and Race in Marmaris (March and October)
• International Bosphorus Cup in Istanbul (May)
• Istanbul Channel Regatta – International Offshore Races, Marmaris to Rhodes (June)
• International Istanbul Optimist Week (June-July)
• IODA World Team Racing Championship and IODA World Sailing Championship in Cesme (July)
• International Turkish Navy Cup in Istanbul (July)
• International Istanbul Sailing Week in Istanbul (August)
• International Ataturk Dam Sailing Competition in Sanliurfa (September)
• Bozburun International Gulet Festival in Bozburun, Marmaris (October).After the League Championship Series Spring Split playoffs, Team SoloMid had announced that they will be holding tryouts for a new support player following Bora “YellOwStaR” Kim’s departure from the team.
The news was published on TSM’s official website, citing that YellOwstaR had expressed his desire to make a return to Europe, despite leading his team to the North American LCS finals.
TSM will be holding tryouts to find the right man to take his place, as they had not decided on a replacement for the French support. He has also not revealed any team that he will be joining in the EU region.
“After the Spring Split playoffs, our support Bora ‘YellOwStaR’ Kim has expressed a desire to return to Europe for the remainder of the season. As such we are announcing open tryouts for the Support position on our League of Legends roster,” the announcement read.
“We are seeking the best possible player across all regions to fill his spot on the team. We would prefer a player with fluency in English. If interested, reach out to your team owners to help coordinate a tryout with us,” it added.
Since his time with Fnatic in 2015, Kim came to be recognized as one of the best team captains in League of Legends in the western regions.
More than just a leader, Kim went well beyond leading his team as he rebuilt the organization’s entire roster which then went ahead to win the LCS two consecutive times and secure a place at the 2015 League of Legends World Championship semifinals.
However, it appeared that he struggled following his transition to the North American region and TSM, as the team did not perform as well as many hoped.
They had a roller coaster of a season, falling short time and time again even as everyone favored the team in the tournament.
But even with such setbacks, the team managed to pull through into the playoffs and eliminated Cloud 9 and regular splits Immortals, before they stop short and lost to Counter Logic Gaming in a thrilling final.
There are no obvious replacements for Kim as of yet, but given the fact that teams usually release players in-between LCS splits the open spot won’t stay that way for long. TSM had followed suit, revealing in the announcement that they are open for negotiations for Kim’s expired contract.This is not only one of our favorite game day soups, we love having this one year round!

Human Cloning: A Catholic Perspective (How the Unthinkable Became Inevitable)Jade mining in Hkamti Township, Sagaing region. Photo: Aung Ko Oo/Mizzima
Myanmar soldiers shot dead four itinerant workers on Wednesday after they tried to enter a mine to search for gems cast aside by its military owners, according to a local MP.
Eleven others were injured when the soldiers opened fire at the mine, in the northwestern region of Sagaing, which is controlled by the military-backed Union of Myanma Economic Holdings Ltd (UMEHL).
The soldiers were thought to be working as security guards at the site, one of dozens of jade mines in the area.
"Yesterday they (UMEHL) warned the freelance miners not to come inside of the site," local lawmaker Maung Tay told AFP.
"But the miners went there this morning and they shot them. There are four miners dead and eleven injured and they are at the hospital now."
The incident comes the same day a screening of a film about the jade industry by Global Witness in Yangon was abruptly cancelled.
Journalists who attended the event at Parkroyal Hotel were read a statement from the hotel saying the corruption watchdog had not gained written permission from the Yangon regional government before the screening.
The film, already available online, explored how Myanmar's military has reaped huge profits from the jade mines in northern Kachin and used them to fuel long-running conflicts with local ethnic groups.
It also called on the government of Aung San Suu Kyi to focus on regulating the jade industry as part of peace talks with armed ethnic groups that are due to start next week.
Myanmar produces the world's finest jadeite, a near-translucent green stone prized in China, where it is known as the "stone of heaven" and believed to bring health and luck.
An investigation by Global Witness found Kachin's mines produced some $31 billion of jade in 2014 alone, equivalent to almost half the country's official GDP that year.
But little of the bounty trickles down to impoverished locals who are left to sift through the rubble left by the mining firms that control the industry -- many of them controlled by military families and drug lords.
Hundreds of itinerant miners are killed by landslides every year searching for gems.
Earlier this month police opened a case against five gem scavengers who discovered a huge jade boulder weighing 8.7 tons in Hpakant, Myanmar's main jade-producing region.
© AFPTiphaine Rivière’s graphic novel, Notes on a Thesis, concerns the time (originally three years, became five) she spent writing a thesis on Kafka. She left a job teaching disadvantaged children and she embarked on a journey – that saw her taking classes, presenting papers at international conferences but also working in the academic admin office alongside slightly embittered academic folk – which also saw her somewhat lose the sympathy of her family, participate in the break-up of her relationship and come out the other side adult and changed.
All of which makes this sound a lot more serious than it actually is. Rivière’s book is slightly manic, in keeping no doubt with the effect of trying to focus on a sole topic for a number of years as your life and the world around you continues to change. If you work in an academic environment yourself, or if you have a PhD or even a Masters to your name, you’ll find chuckles here – but, at the same time, it lacks a certain perspective, is somewhat self-obsessed without seeming to recognise its own self-obsession and isn’t quite as funny as it thinks it is. There are slight forays (we glimpse the life of her adviser at various points) but it would have been nice to learn a little more of the peripheral characters (is Brigitte Claude, the grumpy administrator Rivière works alongside a Hubert? We’ll never know).
There are also nice flourishes that cast Rivière as a kind of ditsy Audrey Hepburn-type and
sometimes the book seems to be yearning towards a simpler kind of comedy but it’s a simpler kind of comedy that Rivière seems to resist fully embracing. Conversely, when the novel is at it’s darkest (the lovely page frame on p153, see right), and we sense we might get a greater depth to proceedings, she skips forward two years and so once more we swerve around what might have been opportunities to make the book better and stronger.
Obviously, fans of graphic novels know that – after hip hop – graphic novels are just about the most self-referential art form there is and Rivière just about makes the grade in terms of creating a book about a person experiencing a thing that hasn’t had a graphic novel written about it yet (to the best of our knowledge). What it doesn’t do is quite rise above its ambitions. We have what we’ve got, and it’s alright without being exceptional.
Any Cop?: If like comics, if you have a PhD, then we would say this book is very definitely for you. Everyone else? Don’t quite take the “wickedly funny” line on the back of the book as being gospel.Middle school students learning English as a second language may not have to keep crossing town for an education.
The Salt Lake City Board of Education is considering dissolving the ESL magnet program at Hillside Intermediate School to keep students in their own neighborhoods. A proposed time line would pace the move, which could require boundary changes, over two years.
The idea recommended by the district is based on research and national trends. But it also follows a rape of an ESL student who was waiting for the bus.
Hillside is a “magnet” school for students learning English. It enrolls 325 ESL students, district numbers show.
The district’s other four middle schools also enroll ESL students, from 76 students at Clayton to 342 at Glendale, the district reports. Those schools have a few ESL teachers, coordinators or counselors or use special reading programs to meet student needs, Dale Rees, ESL teacher on special assignment at the district office, said Tuesday at a school board study session.
The magnet program was set up a decade ago with help of a grant under Title VII of the Bilingual Education Act, Superintendent Darline Robles said.
But now, ESL students make up half Hillside’s enrollment, raising an important issue for state educational equity coordinator Richard Gomez.
“If you get too many kids from a given neighborhood being bused to a school in significant numbers, there is an issue of are we segregating the Alternative Language Services programs. Kids learn best in an integrated school setting with other kids from their own neighborhood,” Gomez said Wednesday. He said the district should study the issue to “determine where is the best setting to most equitably provide services to those limited-English-proficiency students.”
The U.S. Office of Civil Rights supports ESL kids attending their neighborhood schools, a district report states. Students educated in their own communities gain greater commitment to their school, which can increase achievement and help prevent drop-outs. Bus schedules also may keep students from access to extracurricular activities, socialization and parent involvement at school.
“The distance between school and home is the thing that worries me most,” Hillside principal Jane Larson told the board. Recently, one girl attempted to use a UTA bus to go home and ended up lost in the transfer downtown. “Remember, there’s a language barrier. . . . I’m afraid I’m going to lose one.”
Safety also has been a concern for parents.
Glendale immigrants last January asked the district to help them ensure their children safe passage to school following the rapes of two girls. One victim was walking to Glendale Middle School in December; the other was a Hillside student who had been dropped off at the bus stop.
Dismantling the magnet program would have a ripple effect. And board member Ila Rose Fife wonders if the schools have adequate resources and space.
If the magnet program is dissolved, Hillside would lose 283 ESL students. Bryant would pick up 52; Clayton, 13; Glendale, 129; and Northwest, 89.
Glendale principal Larry Peterson said space would be tight and he would need resources from Hillside. But, he said, “We will make it work.”
Robles indicated such enrollment changes could bring boundary changes or require a new school. She suggested talking with principals in the coming weeks.
The board expressed interest moving forward.
“It’s a mind-expanding, socially broadening experience to have these children in their schools,” school board President Kathy Black said.And you would not believe how many of these little capsicums we have eaten this year and there are still plenty more. The Little Girl takes them whole in her lunch. I'll definitely be looking to add these to my list of must plant. Zero maintenance after planting and still providing a steady stream of produce is a winner in my book.
and I'm still not sure what to do with these (if anything) this year.

McCullough has called The Great Bridge America’s Eiffel Tower, and the 60 Minutes piece details the extreme difficulties of building it by hand in the 1860s and ’70s. Then correspondent Morely Safer says this:
McCullough’s pantheon of heroes includes Washington Roebling, who oversaw the bridge’s construction, and his father John, a German immigrant who designed it.
(McCullough: [Washington Roebling] was a new American, he was a very proud American, he wanted to show, this is what we can do, we Americans. And he certainly did.)
Helpful image of Roebling père et fils:
But they didn’t do it alone. What Safer and McCullough failed to mention: Washington’s wife, Emily, gave herself a crash course in engineering and finished overseeing construction of the bridge after the Mister was sidelined by the bends.
Fittingly, the Brooklyn Bridge features a plaque memorializing Emily Roebling’s extraordinary contribution to its creation.
Too bad 60 Minutes didn’t see fit to honor her as well.
How many died building it?

There were quite a few others that suffered life-long diabilities, too.

As David Johnson and Jeff VanVonderen state in their book The Subtle Power of Spiritual Abuse, leaders in an abusive religious system “spend a lot of time focused on their own authority and reminding others of it, as well.”[i] Those with true spiritual power walk their talk. Their life is their message. Cain’s life is a lie, a sham, a charade. He must spend all his time telling you how great and powerful he is to cover up the farce.
The control issues in my cainistic church grew stronger and increasingly more destructive over the years. For example, before a person could teach classes in this church, it was mandatory that they complete a two year program to become a licensed instructor. One day Cain boldly announced to all the teachers that starting immediately it was mandatory that they attend every Sunday service, and if their attendance was not in agreement with his new ruling, he would revoke their privilege to teach classes at the church. Everyone must come underneath Cain.
That was the day my friend, Pam (name has been changed to protect her privacy), walked out. Although she had been a member and a licensed instructor for decades, she dropped out of the church never to return. She did not quibble or protest but prudently walked out of the mire of control and misuse. There would have been no advantage in talking to Cain about his decree because once he made a decision, there was no turning back. Furthermore, nobody questions Cain without paying for it, and he never forgets a dissenter. Even if Pam believed God called her to be a teacher, Cain determined the conditions of that calling. If the instructors taught classes at the church, then they must pay the price of listening to his sermons each and every Sunday.
Likewise, the staff at the cainistic church was overworked and underpaid due to his autocratic leadership. He demanded long hours without complaints. Both burnout and turnover were vast. When fiscal deficit hit the roof, we learned that the staff had received one 3 percent raise in 5 years while the cainistic minister had received a 10 percent raise every year. The monies were unquestionably appropriated to the minister first, and the staff was considered if there was money left over. He also made sure he had a contract, not a salary—all of which exposed his lack of empathy. There was no feeling for others, only for him.
As long as the church board did nothing to prevent this distortion and unfairness, he got away with it. There were nine board members that made business assessments and decisions with Cain. Where were they during all this staff abuse? Why did they blindly follow his dictates without daring to go against his decisions? In short, they complied to avoid being shamed. The shame Cain doled out was so vindictive and nasty at times, it was akin to an emotional crucifixion.
While I was there, the cainistic minister harassed and lost six worship assistants in seven years. One of his dirty little control tricks was to ask where his assistant was during the middle of a Sunday service as if he suddenly needed her to check the thermostat or get him a bottle of water because his throat was dry and he was having trouble speaking.
If she was not in the sanctuary at that moment he called out her name, she caught hell later. I suspected he usually did that after he had already watched her leave the room. He was that devious. Destructive, malignant Cains find enjoyment in seeing others suffer. They are extremely mean-spirited and diabolical, always looking for a reason to lord their power over an Enabler and punish her. After one of the assistants quit, she quietly told me that nothing was ever good enough for him. No matter how hard she tried, he always criticized something about her.
I watched him move from assistant to assistant, heaping spiteful mistreatment on his targets who had once believed in him like I had believed in him, but who turned into nothing more than his battered toys. He picked at their flaws and just before they smacked the proverbial wall, he withdrew the abuse, feigning that he didn’t know what he had done to upset them. They must be supersensitive, he decided. He was always so blameless, so innocent of any wrongdoing.
If he did not know his crime, then he could not be held responsible for it, could he? Like the story of Cain and Abel, even when God tried to show Cain his mistakes by letting the straw smolder rather that burn, Cain refused to admit he made a mistake. Instead, he made one last attempt to deny everything. “Am I my brother’s keeper?” he retorted to God. Heaven forbid that he should stand up and accept responsibility for killing Abel.
Hundreds of demoralized staff, speechless board members, disgruntled congregation and attendees fled when they caught on to the hypocrisy. I asked administration and board members, who were incessantly talking about “building the numbers” (which meant adding more members to the rolls) why they did not talk with the people who left to find out why they had left. It fell on deaf ears. When I left for almost a year, not one person ever contacted me to say they missed me or ask me why I had left the church. Cain knew why, and his administration and followers knew, too. As you might imagine, the numbers dwindled and the door was always swinging.
Volunteers were treated with the same perfunctory manner. If the minister felt threatened by a volunteer, he would schedule a mandatory meetings at 9:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning when a volunteer, who was lovingly and willingly giving free time, might have personal activities scheduled or want to sleep in. I once retorted, “You’d think we worked here the way they treat us.” There are no such thing as personal boundaries when Cain abuses his authority; They are routinely ignored or trampled on.Lake Tahoe Real Estate Property | 253 Deer Court, Incline Village, NV 89451 US

Product: Sentry Spelling Checker Engine Windows SDK
Problems:
The programming language I use doesn't support hexadecimal constants.
How can I convert the license key you provided to decimal?
Solution:
To convert your license key to decimal:
The license key provided by Wintertree Software is expressed as a hexadecimal constant. The reason is the license key is an unsigned 32-bit integer, and most common programming languages (Visual Basic, C/C++/C#, Delphi) know to treat a hexadecimal constant as an unsigned integer. Some programming languages (e.g., PowerBuilder) do not support hexadecimal constants, so the license key provided by Wintertree Software must be converted to decimal.
The easiest way to do this is to use the Windows calculator utility in "scientific" mode. The calculator utility is found in the Accessories folder in the Start menu. To enable "scientific" mode, select View + Scientific. To convert your hexadecimal license key to decimal, follow these steps:
Make sure the "Hex" radio button is selected. Note that a row of buttons labeled "A" - "F" near the numeric keypad in the calculator window becomes enabled.
Enter your hexadecimal license key (e.g., 1234ABCD). Use the "A" - "F" buttons to enter any letters in your hexadecimal license key.
Select the "Dec" radio button. Your license key in decimal (e.g., 305441741) appears in the calculator's display.
If your license key overflows:
The license key is an unsigned integer. Roughly speaking, this means it uses all 32 bits of a 32-bit integer. A signed 32-bit integer, on the other hand, uses one bit to represent the sign, and the other 31 bits to represent the value. The largest positive signed value that can be represented in a 32-bit integer is 2147483647 decimal (7FFFFFFF hexadecimal). A decimal value larger than this may cause an overflow. If your hexadecimal license key is 8 digits long and starts with 8, 9, or A-F, it will convert to a large unsigned decimal integer that may cause an overflow. If your hexadecimal license key is fewer than 8 digits long, or starts with 0-7, it will not cause an overflow when converted to decimal (provided it is stored or passed as a 32-bit integer and not a 16-bit integer).
If your programming language supports unsigned decimal constants, you can probably avoid the overflow by indicating that the license key is unsigned. For example, in languages derived from C, an unsigned constant is indicated with the suffix "U", so a large integer is indicated as unsigned like this: 2882343476U. Consult your programming language's documentation, or contact the people who support it, to enquire about unsigned decimal constants.
If your programming language does not support unsigned decimal constants, you can convert a large unsigned decimal integer to a signed, negative decimal integer by subtracting 4294967296. For example, suppose your license key is ABCD1234 hexadecimal:
Converted to decimal (see above) results in 2882343476
2882343476 - 4294967296 = -1412623820
This negative value (-1412623820) will not cause an overflow (provided it is stored or passed as a 32-bit integer and not a 16-bit integer). Make sure you include the minus sign!Cartoon: America’s Problem With Pain Meds

Sometimes I wonder why I bother.. Read more »
*This blog post was originally published at Movin' Meat*
I was a panelist at Edelman’s CHPA New Media Summit today in New Brunswick, NJ. Matthew Holt (of the Healthcare Blog and Health 2.0) was the keynote speaker, and I participated on a panel discussion with Dr. Roy Poses. It was exciting to meet Roy in person for the first time, as I’ve been following his policy blog for some time.
Matthew presented a very rosy picture of Health 2.0 (consumer-driven healthcare), more or less suggesting that it could provide a large part of the solution to our current healthcare crisis. I countered with a more cautious view, explaining that expert engagement would be critical to Health 2.0’s success.
Matthew argued that sites like Patients Like Me were enabling patients “to do their own clinical trials online,” and that this was opening a whole new avenue for research. Dr. Poses and I were fairly concerned about this suggestion, primarily because we understand how easy it is to draw false conclusions from data, especially when the data are not collected in a systematic fashion.
I explained to the audience that association does not prove causation (E.g. Do matches cause lung cancer? No, though it’s true that people who smoke are more likely to carry matches). I also described a case in which a Health 2.0 principle went terribly awry: a group of consumers were asked to rate their medications for efficacy by disease/condition. This was supposed to leverage the “wisdom of the crowds” to determine which medicines worked best (by popular vote). Of course, the result was that every pain syndrome (low back pain, headaches, fibromyalgia, etc.) resulted in a narcotic pain medicine as the highest ranked treatment option. Do you really need Oxycontin for that tension headache of yours? Obviously, narcotics are popular among users – but are a last resort for pain management in the real world. The “wisdom of crowds” rarely works in healthcare.
Matthew agreed to disagree with me on a number of issues – but we certainly found common ground on the primary care crisis. He and I both believe that a shortage of primary care physicians is going to result in a catastrophic shortage of care for Baby Boomers in the next decade. Dr. Poses added that primary care physicians make the same salary as school teachers in his home state of Rhode Island.
I think we have to agree with KevinMD – the way forward is not going to be pretty.…USC grad places 10th in CPA licensure exam
Marcia P. Butastas earned an average of 89.33 and tied for 10th place in the Certified Public Accountant licensure examination administered by the Professional Regulatory Board of Accountancy in October 2017 in nine cities in the Philippines.
Three of six first-time takers from USC, including Butastas, passed the examination. Nationwide, only 4,511 examinees out of 14,816 takers passed the October 2017 licensure examination.
In other news, 35 (53.85%) Carolinians passed the Electronics Engineer licensure examination also held in October 2017 in five cities nationwide. Eight additional examinees had conditional passing. Overall, 2,235 examinees successfully passed the examination out of the 4,784 takers.

Devised at first to keep the strong in awe.
Our strong arms be our conscience, swords and law!”
(King Richard III, act 5, sc. 3)
Comment. Richard III was right. Conscience is but a word – actually a dirty word, at least in the current judicial system, as the facts will here demonstrate.
To unequivocally prove the point we must first gather some apparently unconnected strands. It won’t be long, yet we must crave the forbearance of the reader.
The story starts in Utah and in no way the image shown above can reproduce the awe and beauty of the original Utah landscape – to borrow from Wordsworth, a view with “the glory and freshness of a dream”.
But five years ago the Goddess Democracy and her husband the God of Profit set their eyes on the magic Utah landscape. They sought the assistance of Chrysus, son of Profit and God of Gold. Together they set up an auction in Salt Lake City to buy tens of thousands of acres of the magic, irreplaceable land of Utah. They wanted to drill for oil, or do some fracking, or undertake whatever other diabolical operation designed to destroy both land and environment.
To their surprise, not everyone agreed with the idea (in Utah and elsewhere). Actually most didn’t, but Chrysus and his father Profit since long have converted Democracy into a useful trap where “the credulous fools are caught.”(Othello, 4.1)
And here enters the real hero of our story, Mr. Tim DeChristopher, a brilliant, clever and articulate young man who devised a genial procedure to foil the wicked plans of Profit, Chrysus and “Democracy”. He attended the auction and, unbeknown to the rapacious and bidding hyenas, he outbid them all. Of course he had no money to sustain the bids but in the meantime he saved Utah.
The naïve reader may think that the state of Utah, along with Democracy (‘power of the people’, let’s not forget) should have honored the savior of her land. Instead Tim DeChristopher was promptly arrested and charged with the crime of “disrupting the bidding”. What comes next out-orwells even George Orwell.
The Public Prosecutor offered the Defendant a deal. He would admit to the crime and serve a nominal sentence in jail (30 days or thereabout), or go for a jury trial. Conscious of having done a duty to the State of Utah and to his conscience – having sought no benefit for himself whatsoever – Tim DeChristopher chose a trial by jury.
A mistake, because in the system as it is administered today, the jury trial is rigged in such a way that the prosecutor almost always wins, as we will demonstrate in the topic instance.
Prior to the trial a pamphlet had been circulated to the jury. Besides the customary rules applicable to the proceedings, the pamphlet contained a quotation by John Adams, (for our international visitors one of the founders of the Republic). Adams wrote in 1771, “It’s not only ….(the juror’s) right, but his duty, in that case, to find the verdict according to his own best understanding, judgment, and conscience, even if in direct opposition to the direction of the court.”
The Public Prosecutor, incensed by pride and resentment, took issue at the presence of the quotation in the jury pamphlet. Whereupon the Judge called the prospective jurors one by one in the presence of himself and the Prosecutor.
The reader can visualize the intimidating atmosphere of a tribunal, decorated with the splendid trappings of temporal greatness and government power. And for most jurors, being individually called to answer a Judge is a one-time “shock-and-awe” experience.
To each prospective juror the Judge said the following, “I will instruct you to follow the law and not your conscience. Now, if you can follow my instructions you can be a juror, otherwise you cannot. Are you capable of following my instructions?”
What average human being can refuse the intimidating instructions of a Judge, delivered in such imposing surroundings, with the high tide of pomp beating on the high shores of the court? We are all instinctively sensitive to the symbolic meaning of visible things. Who dares to disregard the landmarks of orthodoxy? All said yes, they would follow the instructions of the Judge and not the dictates of their conscience.
Conclusion. The savior of the Utah environment was found guilty and condemned, by unanimous decision, to two years in prison, to be spent in the company of common criminals. He was just recently released.
There are four, actually five considerations to be added to this episode. They show the tragic state of our so-called “democracy”.
One. Perhaps influenced by the knowledge of DeChristopher’s trial, another judge declared the sale (and the auction) of the Utah landscape illegal. A development that should have meant the reversal of the Defendant’s conviction – but it didn’t.
Two. John Adams was also one of the founders of the Constitution. The Judge’s menacing demand to disregard John Adam’s pronouncement shows at what level the respect for the Constitution has fallen.
Three. Notwithstanding all this it is still to be hoped that conscience not be considered “but a word”. Though clearly, he who does so today, swims against the tide of the times – as shown by the sober evidence of this and other similar cases.
Four. The reader will still remember the BP explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, an environmental disaster that words cannot even begin to describe. He may recall that the oil companies even supplied free girls to the regulators sent by the government to inspect the companies. There were months of investigations, extremely lengthy discussions on the meaning of this or that word, all to the purpose of a monumental and universal coverage of everybody’s bottom. Not one, not one individual was ever prosecuted or sent to jail. Same thing with the bank scandals and the Wall Street scams – the clear and illegal production of either fraud or forgery.
Tim DeChristopher, instead, spent two years in jail for doing something benefiting us all. So much for “law and order”, so much for “democracy”.
Five, and perhaps as instructive as four. Speaking of his detention, DeChristopher said that, during his two years in jail, he had met about 50 people who really deserved to be locked-up. Of these, five were inmates, the rest guards.

The Texas Tribune reports the agreement was reached during a mediation session.
WATCH:
In 2013, a lawsuit was filed against the Texas Department of State Health Services after it issued new identification requirements for parents to obtain birth certificates for their children. The new requirements provided that counties could no longer accept foreign passports without a valid visa or Mexican consular IDs as valid forms of identification. The lawsuit alleged these changes violated the constitutional rights of the children.
Under the agreement, Mexican consular IDs will still no longer be accepted as valid forms of identification. However, Texas will reportedly expand the acceptable forms of identification to include Mexican voter ID cards that can now be obtained through the mail. The state will also expand acceptable secondary forms of identification to include paycheck stubs and utility bills. Parents from Central American countries will also now be able to obtain documents from their respective consulates as secondary forms of identification.
“This agreement will allow the state to continue to provide necessary birth certificates to authorized people and do so in a way that maintains the security of state birth records,” health department spokesman Chris Van Deusen told the news outlet. “The purpose of the identification requirement is to ensure that individuals requesting birth certificates are who they say they are.

Frontman Niilo Sevänen comments:
”We are very excited to get back on the road again! Last autumn a serious illness in my family forced us to make some drastic decisions and for example cancel one tour altogether. Since then things have progressed very well and steadily so everything looks a lot better at the moment. We’ve only made festivals and short trips this year but in 2017 we’ll be back on making longer tours all over the world.
The forthcoming Winter’s Gate album has been mixed by Dan Swanö and it sounds amazing. Playing this 40 minute monster song will be an interesting challenge in a live situation but we can’t wait to do this! This European tour in January will be a rare opportunity for our fans to hear the whole epic song live, so it will be a very special show every night.”
The new album will be released via Century Media Records on September 23rd, 2016. It is built around.

The paper airplane launcher and the full-sized aircraft in the flight gallery are packed with budding aerospace engineers. Morning shows at the Dome Theatre are sold out. At the RBC Someday Street exhibit on the sunlit top floor of the building, children are using heavy equipment to excavate a new building project, diagnosing the ailments of teddy bears at the health centre, and harvesting vegetables at the farm and sending them on to the community market to be priced and put on display. A couple of kids are hamming it up at the Someday Street Theatre, while others are developing ideas in the art and music studio. Bubble Park — a giant soap bubble laboratory — is full to capacity.
Everybody is having fun. More importantly they’re all learning something new. “This goes beyond the education system,” says Dov Bercovici, the CEO of the Discovery Centre. “It’s informal learning, which can be as important as formal learning.”
It’s a style of learning that Bercovici has long appreciated. When he was growing up in Montreal, his father often took him to the Dow Planetarium.
“I’d sit there and be amazed about our place in the universe,” he recalls. The planetarium complex also had a large geology collection that inspired Bercovici to begin a rock collection of his own. Later, he became vice-president of operations at Acadia and worked to develop the university into a destination for meetings, events and anyone looking for a place to think outside the box. The Discovery Centre is a continuation of that.
The Discovery Centre is the most impressive thing to hit the Halifax waterfront in a while — a $20 million hands-on science museum built in a section of Nova Scotia Power’s corporate headquarters that once housed giant electrical generation turbines. A former generating station that dominated Halifax’s skyline in the days before high rise buildings, the industrial edifice began morphing into one of the city’s most innovative building projects two decades ago. In the late 1990s, it was converted into a giant sound stage called Electropolis. Later, NSPI retrofitted it into a dramatic waterfront showcase — the first building in Atlantic Canada to achieve LEED Platinum certification, with features such as rain water collectors, an energy efficient facade, natural light atriums and a system that uses harbour water for heating and cooling. The Centre’s impact is the reason that the Halifax Chamber of Commerce has veered from its normal route and deemed the Discovery Centre the Person of the Year.
The Discovery Centre is the building’s latest addition, a five year project that began when Bercovici approached Chris Huskilson, the CEO of NSPI’s parent company Emera, with the idea. Huskilson was enthusiastic about the idea from the start. Emera offered a 25-year, rent-free lease and also donated $1 million to the project.
The turbine room, the cavernous space where huge turbines once churned crude oil into electricity, is the new Discovery Centre’s dramatic location.
It’s been left open and sparse for a reason. “We didn’t fight the building,” says Bercovici. We didn’t want to hide it’s industrial heritage. We wanted to celebrate it.” It’s not a unique idea. The Tate Modern in London centres around the turbine hall of the former Bankside Power Station, and Bercovici admits that that facility provided inspiration.
A hanging staircase ascends four stories from the innovation lab on the ground floor to the top floor exhibits; along the way it becomes a keyboard for part of its length, where visitors can tap out a tune. There’s an open shafted elevator as well; the four storey staircase is featured to promote good health — part of the centre’s mandate, says Bercovici.
Discovery Centre’s raison d’etre can be summed up in a word that seems entirely appropriate for an old generating plant: STEAM. It’s an acronym that stands for science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics. The arts component, often left out of traditional science museum experiences, is particularly vital to the formula, says Bercovici. With much more room than the old Discovery Centre building on Barrington Street, more exhibits than before are aimed at teenagers or adults. The centre serves double duty as a public maker space — a place where minds can wander and dream up new ideas. “It’s really to inspire all Nova Scotians with the marvels of STEAM,” says Bercovici. “You are going to get ideas here, and we can help you develop them. We’re not going to do all the work for you but we’re a resource.”
Many outside organizations have become involved with raising money and providing ideas for exhibits, including about 20 corporations, five major Canadian banks, universities, governments and private donors. Medavie Health Foundation has sponsored the Medavie Health Gallery, while IMP Aerospace has sponsored the Flight Gallery. Much of Emera’s donation has gone to develop the Nova Scotia Power Energy Gallery with hands-on exhibits about energy production, physics and conservation.
The Dome Theatre is the centrepiece of the facility, a 65-seat planetarium that features star shows and full dome films inside while images and exhibit backdrops are projected on its exterior surface. The Michelin Innovation Lab on the first floor allows visitors of all ages to design electric circuits, work with unusual materials or snap together pulleys and gears. It was funded through a $500,000 donation from Michelin, the tire company’s largest ever donation in Canada. Throughout the day talented science presenters stage shows for enthralled audiences, while the Wilson’s Featured Exhibit Gallery presents a new show every few months.
It all seems to come together effortlessly, but it takes plenty of hard work behind the scenes. The Discovery Centre has a large staff of talented people. A staff of 25 full-time and 50 part-time employees work alongside hundreds of volunteers. Some are scientists or university graduates with science degrees. A few are professional performers — comedians, actors and musicians. Many bring other talents to the mix: They are artists, marketers, business people and managers. “Everyone is very well trained,” says Bercovici. “We all work together and we’re all learning how to do a lot of different jobs. We have a full-time dome presenter. She’s an astronomy graduate who knows the subject really well. But other people are learning how to use the dome as well. They’re learning how to turn exhibits off and on; how the Discovery Centre works. We’re all working together, sharing ideas and having a good time in the process.”
Not everything happens at the Discovery Centre’s waterfront headquarters. A fleet of vehicles wrapped in Discovery Centre colours travels around the province and beyond, staging award winning science shows in schools and communities. The centre is also planning to export its expertise as a promoter of science to other communities both nationally and internationally. “We don’t necessarily want to duplicate something that we’re doing here,” says Bercovici. “It’s more like helping them customize something that works in their community, using the tools we’ve developed. The American Museum of Natural History does work all over the world. So does Science North in Sudbury, with a population half our size. The Discovery Centre wants to be in that space.”
The public is hungry to see the Discovery Centre’s sparkling new venue. In the first eight weeks of operations 70,000 people poured into the facility, many of them during March break. That’s compared to around 80,000 total for a typical peak year at the old Discovery Centre on Barrington Street — a record that is likely to fall even before the busy tourism season gears up. The building’s location along the busy Halifax Harbour Walk places the Discovery Centre at the centre of a network of downtown attractions that includes the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, Pier 21, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia and the Port of Halifax itself. “The Halifax waterfront is the most visited destination in Atlantic Canada,” says Bercovici. “The cruise ship season is expanding and growing. It’s becoming a real magnet for tourists and visitors. We add to that mix and also receive a lot of benefits from being here as well.”
But like all great performers, the Discovery Centre is saving a few things for the second act. A 3,000-sq.-ft. Ocean Gallery is planned for next year. It’s a natural fit for a waterfront museum space, one that’s been on the drawing board since the new centre was first conceived. The Ocean Gallery will showcase the ocean technology sector that has developed in Halifax with hands on displays of remotely operated vehicles, ocean tracking technology and a large touch tank featuring live local marine species. “We’re going to show people how work is done in our oceans,” says Bercovici. “And we’re going to do it in very fun and engaging ways — like we always do.”Archive

ACU Melbourne Library Manager Karen Campbell pictured with Helen Johnson's painting '23 Specific References'.
Helen Johnson was born in 1979 in Melbourne, Australia where she currently lives and works.
In her paintings, Johnson often addresses colonial history and its ongoing impact on Australia’s political and social realities. Her work blends figuration and abstraction, by representing people, animals and objects from the past in full and in fragments or silhouettes. She draws on a variety of sources ranging from ‘emojis’ and cartoons to religious European painting and Greek mythology.
ACU Art Curator, Caroline Field is delighted to present this newly acquired work by Helen Johnson titled 23 Specific References, 2012.
She states: "While complementing the historical representations of the Madonna and child held within the University’s collection, Johnson’s contemporary interpretation of the subject is imbued with grace, tenderness and reflection. The delicate application of pigment and gold leaf on linen overlaid in a translucent veil of silk enhances the poignant, haunting beauty of this sacred image and reminds the viewer of the power of humanity in its most intimate and fragile state."
23 Specific References is presently displayed in the ACU Melbourne Library, Level One.
Campus Library Manager, Karen Campbell (pictured) commented: "The serenity of the work and its invitation to quiet contemplation will create a soothing break for students who want to gather their thoughts before diving into their study."

Reinforced concrete: thermal conductivity 2.30 W/(mK)
Construction timber: thermal conductivity 0.13 W/(m/K)
Cellulose insulation: thermal conductivity 0.039 W/(m/K) Thermal bridges are areas where for example more heat is lost through a switch in materials than in neighbouring structural elements. Thanks to the low thermal conductivity of wood the thermal bridge effect of wooden structural elements is very slight. Any thermal bridges that arise can be minimised with the help of simple constructional measures.
With customary wall and roof construction, supporting elements (wood parts) that are used regularly alternate with highly effective insulation materials. The factor that determines the influence of thermal bridges for wooden constructions is thus the proportion of construction timber in the structural elements.
Wood frame constructions have very good insulation properties since the supporting structure and the insulation material are in the same plane and almost all the cross-section of the wall can be used for thermal protection. Additional layers of insulation material e.g. on the outside or an insulated installation section on the inside enable insulation levels to be attained that are required in a passive house (heating requirement of < 0.15 kW/m²). An overall structural element thickness of 30 cm is already sufficient to attain this passive house standard.

The Transit Elevated Bus (TEB) was tested on the road in Qinhuangdao City on August 2, gaining enormous media and public interest. However, new reports are stemming from the Chinese media that the entire endeavor is essentially a scam.
According to RT, “the ‘road test’ was nothing more than a publicity stunt and that its sole purpose was to drum up more interest among potential investors for a project that would never actually be created.”
Other problems include the fact that the TEB’s designer’s highest level of education was elementary school, most cars will not be able to fit underneath the bus’s 2.1 meter clearance, and the bus itself violates the height limit for vehicles on Chinese roads.
Car News China also noted that the construction of the TEB was shoddy, built with rubber wheels that run on gutters rather than an actual rail system.
The funding behind it could additionally be illegitimate: the company was potentially “misleading investors and crowdfunding their project illegally,” RT reports.
While an extraordinary idea in theory, it unfortunately appears that we are quite some time away from anything resembling the TEB populating our freeways and alleviating major cities’ traffic crises.

Well, our new house has four stunning peony bushes so I snapped a few photos of them tonight as I was leaving the house after much weeding and working. I haven’t at all forgotten to post the “before” pictures, I just have to get them all in queue for a blog post! In the meantime, I thought I would leave you to with some springy peony goodness.

[SIEM REAP] In a vast parking lot outside Cambodia's famed Angkor Wat temples complex stands a new museum built by North Korea, part of a lucrative charm offensive by a hermit state exporting its monumental art to a handful of foreign allies.
 centuries and the construction of Angkor Wat.
That a closed, hardline communist state might choose to build a museum honouring a feudal Southeast Asian dynasty - and foot the US$24 million price tag - may initially appear surprising.
But Cambodia has long belonged to a select and somewhat motley band of North Korean allies.
When the country's late King Norodom Sihanouk was toppled in a 1970 coup, North Korea's founding leader Kim Il-Sung offered him sanctuary.
And when Sihanouk returned after the bloodletting of the Khmer Rouge era, he kept a retinue of North Korean bodyguards for the remainder of his reign and gifted his birth home to Pyongyang for its envoy.
The North's nemesis, South Korea, has also dramatically increased its business presence in Cambodia and its embassy in Phnom Penh remains a haven for North Korean defectors to aim for.
But Cambodia's relations with the North remain strong even as Pyongyang deepens its pariah status with nuclear and missile tests that triggered a fresh round of tough UN sanctions earlier this month.
"Those family connections are not to be underestimated on the North Korean side in terms of the affection that the Kim family have for Cambodia specifically," Adam Cathcart, a North Korea specialist at Britain's Leeds University, told AFP.
The museum is also more than a friendly gesture.
It is the latest in a growing portfolio of artworks that Mansudae has built overseas.
With 1,000 artists on the books the studio is often described as the world's largest. It churns out propaganda pieces and has long been the been the only outlet allowed to produce portraits of the Kim dynasty.
The majority of its overseas work has been in Africa, with Angola, Botswana and Namibia all boasting North Korean-built pieces - the most famous of them Senegal's colossal "African Renaissance Monument".
But it has picked up clients elsewhere, including the German city of Frankfurt who decided Mansudae's artists were the only ones skilled enough to faithfully recreate a 1910 art deco fountain.
Koen de Ceuster, an expert on North Korean art from Leiden University in the Netherlands, says the operation is "very much a business venture". But it has other uses too.
"North Korea has discovered soft power, it has discovered cultural diplomacy... they are trying to broaden the image of what North Korea is about," he told AFP.
As such the Cambodia museum also serves as a "calling card" for future business, he said.
Among the staff at the Siem Reap museum are some 20 North Koreans, some of a tiny percentage of people from the isolated country who ever see life in the outside world.
A few North Korean women work in a souvenir shop selling Mansudae acrylics and oils from between US$100 to US$2,000.
"I've been here six months," said one woman, declining the offer of an on-camera interview.
"There are not so many people at the moment but we have only just opened. Hopefully there will be more in the future," she added in near accentless English she learnt in Pyongyang.
The Cambodian staff are slowly getting to know their North Korean colleagues.
"We try to understand each other, swap stories about our culture," Sor Sei Leang, a 26-year-old Cambodian told AFP.
"They're trying to learn Khmer too so they can go to market and talk to people. They ask us how to say hello, thank you. That sort of thing."
For the Cambodians, the museum is a win-win.
Under the construction terms, North Korea will receive profits for the first ten years of the museum's life. Thereafter profits will be split for a decade and the museum will then be fully owned by Cambodia.
And while some tourists may balk at an attraction that sends hard cash back to North Korea, deputy museum director Yit Chandaroat believes fascination will triumph over censure.
"We are not concerned" about political issues, he said.

Stenographers generated the transcript during the televised hearing, and each Member corrected the transcript for accuracy and clarity before it was printed as an official document—a practice committees still follow.
Jordan received a seat on the prestigious Judiciary Committee during her first term in Congress. Although only a freshman House Member, her experience in the Texas state legislature prepared her for the role. She edited the transcript carefully to emphasize her closing point: “It is reason, not passion, which must guide our deliberations, guide our debate, and guide our decision.” President Nixon resigned from the presidency on August 9, 1974, shortly after the Judiciary Committee had sent three articles of impeachment to the full House to debate.That is now the end of a very long four days at work.

Learning Outcomes
On successful completion of this module students should be able to:
Critically evaluate relevant texts and consider the implications of these texts in performance;e.
Situate ancient and adapted texts in their cultural, political and historical contexts.
Demonstrate an awareness of the wider cultural and theoretical issues raised by adaptations of classical texts.
Produce organized, coherently structured and critically engaged written and oral work.
Aims
The module focuses on adaptations and rewrites of "the classics" of antiquity with a view to asking the followng questions: What is a classic? Is canonical status afforded to such work purely on the grounds of textual antiquity? Why rewrite/adapt such works? What are the theatrical strategies of such reworkings? By looking at a variety of adaptations and rewrites students will develop an understanding of canon-formation and rewriting/performative rereading as a critical paradigm.
Brief description
This module will provide a thorough introduction to plays that are representative of the key genres of Ancient drama (Satyr, Tragedy and Comedy) whilst providing a sound foundation for understanding how these Ancient works have been and continue to be adapted and rewritten, for example as political protest, pacifist messages, critique of aesthetics and canonicity, a contemplation of our present age and beyond. In this respect, the module will provide a thorough overview of Ancient drama, Adaptation theory and a selection of modern (twentieth century and twenty first century) adaptations and rewrites.

I have to say that being able to see the vacuum's contents is a good lesson in humility. That's why, as a Catholic housewife, I recommend this kind of vacuum over one with a bag. Pondering the contents yesterday on the porch, I wanted to run. I didn't actually see them, but I knew that somewhere in that depth of dirt, skin flakes, hair, bits of leaves, and food crumbs, lurked my Dad's fingernail trimmings, several of which I noticed while wielding the clippers, were lined with fecal material. Yes, I had definitely waited too long to trim his nails.
I have come to the conclusion, after much contemplation, that family member's poop really is a defining element of my life, as well as possum poop, dog poop, cat poop, chicken poop, and cow poop. There's much to be contemplated in this revelation. I aim to get to it.
Turning my attention to the beater bar, I used a pair of scissors to pry loose the long hair and then pulled it and the gray hair and some dust/dirt balls out. My stomach turned. I was watching myself and thought, "What right have you to be disgusted? Imagine what gruesome grit Christ deals with from your sins."
"Truly," I answered myself, "the housewife's calling is a continuous calling to die to self."
I remembered also that hair is a symbol of the pride of life. Ah. Such lessons I am given in my daily duties!
Assessing my housewifely career so far, as near as I can tell, it doesn't get easier. Just like the beater bar wrapped round with both my daughter's and my mother's hair, I am called to clean up daily the poop of the circle of life. And to do it joyfully, whether it's from my parents' accidents or rogue possums.
This I am working on. As I told Emma after being repulsed by finding possum poop in my bedroom, "I tried to embrace this trial joyfully and imagine myself smiling, but instead the loathsome visage of a hissing possum popped into my head."
No wonder God keeps sending me more poop.
++++++
I always knew that as we age, we return to our infancy, but I never expected that in caring for my parents, I would constantly have these moments where I am catapulted back to my children's infancy and youth--like when I lean into the car to fasten one of my parents' seat belts, I have these jarring, yet pleasant, flashbacks of buckling my children into our blue Dodge van. Or when I bend over to wash Dad's pee from the front of the toilet and mop up the resulting puddle on the floor, I see vividly my own son as a toddler, butt cheeks squeezed hard together, standing on tiptoe trying valiantly to aim perfectly into the toilet.
3 comments:
Anthony and I joke all the time about all the poop in our lives. Mostly kid poop. There's lots of mouse poop, too, and chicken poop. But the kid poop...with two newly potty trained two year olds and a nearly one year old...sometimes lately we'll hear an older child's voice sing-song from another room, "There's poop on the floor!" and we just laugh because what else can we do? (Besides clean it up, obviously). Last year my mother-in-law gave us a cordless handheld vacuum, much requested by the children, for Christmas. They loved it just as much as they thought they would. It met its demise after less than six months, because some child (we still don't know who) thought to hide his accident on the floor by sucking it up with the handheld vacuum. Everything inside it was covered with poop. Another thing we laugh about is that maybe, if our family makeup was different, we would not automatically assume when we notice a brown spot/smear on a floor that it is poop, but we do.
Oh, my gosh, Emily! I award you an honorary doctorate in Poopology.

Greg said Friday that the sale was motivated by a desire to spend more time with family.
"It was really about not making my close friends and family restaurant widows and widowers any longer," Greg said. "Maybe (it's) not that dramatic but at a certain point ? we don't have a breakfast, but having lunch and dinner occupies you from early in the morning potentially to late at night."
Greg met Giuseppe and Mauricio's father Franco more than a decade ago. Franco asked Greg, who had been working in Osteria since he was 22 years old, to show his older son, Giuseppe, the restaurant ropes. Giuseppe was an undergraduate student at Santa Clara University at the time, Greg said.
The two Carrubba brothers went on to help their father open Caffe Riace in the 1990s, (though they're no longer involved with the restaurant) then various cafes on the Stanford University campus and later their own catering company, Just Catering, which they recently sold. Franco also took over a historic Half Moon Bay grocery store in 2007, embarking on a rocky business deal and journey in the community.
Greg said he's confident in the brothers, who over the years have developed a "top-to-bottom understanding from sandwiches to fine dining (and) things in the middle."
"I've really admired the way they've gone about their business so when it was decided between my father and I that we would have to sell, I called up Giuseppe," he said.
Giuseppe did not return requests for comment.
Greg said the Carrubbas have kept the Osteria staff intact as well as most of the menu, besides eliminating a few items. The two head chefs have been with the restaurant since the beginning, as well as some waiters.

The Carrubbas also did some interior upgrades over the last several weeks.
Osteria, which opened at 247 Hamilton Ave. in the bottom floor of the Cardinal Hotel in 1986, was one of many restaurant ventures for Angelo Piccini, who came to the United States from Italy as a teenager and is now in his 70s.
The exterior of Osteria at 247 Hamilton Ave. in Palo Alto.
Angelo got his start busing tables at restaurants in North Beach in San Francisco, according to the restaurant's website. He later opened several San Francisco restaurants with a cousin before moving to Palo Alto.
Less than two years following Osteria's opening, Angelo opened a second Italian restaurant in Menlo Park. But Angelo sold Carpaccio, still in operation on Crane Street, within the year.
Next came Osteria No. 2, opened in 1989 in Presidio Heights in San Francisco.
Over the years in Palo Alto, in the midst of so many trends and restaurants coming and going, Osteria has been remained a reassuring constant for many diners.
"What we tried to do was offer a clean environment with traditional food at a reasonable price. That was kind of our hope and our formula ? not try to chase trends and things like that," Greg said.
He said the restaurant is in good hands with the Carrubbas, who he believes will faithfully continue the Osteria legacy.
"It's been a part of my heart for so long," he said. "I'm not shocked; I'm not sad; I'm not overly happy. I'm just very content and matter of fact that the timing was right."

Go to any writers group loop, bulletin board, or meeting and you will find a plethora of ailments; mental and physical. I don’t think it is a coincidence that writers suffer from a host of illnesses that I do not find in my non-writer family and friends.
I believe the connection is empathy. The better the writer, the more empathy they contain. Or that could be vice-versa. We don’t just write words. We write people. We write feelings. We have to feel the feelings to write them.
When you read a story with a character who had their heart ripped out, know that the writer got inside that character’s skin. She lived that moment, she felt that moment. She could tell you every nuance of the heart-ripping time.
Belinda pressed her hand to her chest as if it would stop the breaking of her heart. She gasped, the air trapped in her lungs. Gray hovered at the edge of her vision. If she could just hold on for a few more moments it wouldn’t happen. Is she could just turn back time and unhear the words from his lips. He didn’t mean them. He couldn’t mean them. If they didn’t drum in her head until she tried to rip them from her brain. He was leaving her. The thought pinned her in the middle of the room like a statue as the slamming door ripped a picture from the wall and it crashed to the floor. The glass shattered like the jagged edges of her heart. If she moved the pieces would cut through her ribs. She fell to the floor, her knees cracking on the tile. It would be hours before she knew she wasn’t dead, she just wished she were.
Been there, done that, have the T-shirt to prove it.
Empathy is great to write a story, it isn’t so great to wallow in day after day. I cry at Hallmark commercials. I can’t even watch a Hallmark Lifetime movie. To this day, I swear they were produced to rip my heart to shreds. I cry at happy movies. I cry at sad movies. I wear my heart on a sleeve. Sometimes it is so painful to FEEL everything, all the time. I have a friend who wonders where I put them all. That is why I really feel that writers suffer from so much mental anguish and all the ailments that accompany it. We need those emotions to put into our writing. We can’t just turn them off. They are with us, 24/7.
So, next time you are reading a book or watching a movie and the emotion overwhelms you, know that the writer is right there with you, feeling every tear, every laugh, every emotion on the page before you did.
Enjoy the read–tears and all! Jill James

Google Removed 1.7 Million Bad and Fake News Ads. OMG !!! That's a Huge Number!
Google's annual Bad Ads report says that it took down more than double the number of ads in 2016 than it did in 2015, by removing 1.7 billion ads, compared to the 780 million removed in 2015.
Google informed several changes for the big increase in removed ads.
The new Google policy of removing payday loan ads that doesn’t meet certain criteria went into effect in July. It says that it took down more than 5 million payday loan ads since that time. (If you’re wondering why ads are still showing on those search queries, we took a look last October.)
Google also continued to make system updates to be able to spot bad ads more reliably, among them the “trick to click” ads that look like system error notifications to get users to download malware. Google says the number of “trick to click” ads it detected and removed increased six-fold from the previous year, to 112M.
Other bad ads efforts in 2016 included detecting more “self-clicking ads” on mobile devices. While small in comparison to some of the other detection efforts, Google says it disabled more than 23,000 of these ads in 2016, compared to just a few thousand in 2015.
And in a year when “fake news” became news, it’s not all that surprising that fake news ads, or “tabloid cloaking” ads, proliferated. These are the kinds of ads that look like news or entertainment headlines and take users to sites selling things like weight-loss products. Google suspended more than 1,300 accounts in 2016 but says this type of ad is gaining traction because they get clicks.
Also, Google has told that:

The past perfect is mostly used in storytelling to provide background information. A simple, clear main narratives in the past should be based in the simple tense, giving the past perfect the opportunity to provide details of events that happened before the main narrative.
- Jim arrived at the crime scene. He found a man whose head had been cut clean off.
In this example, the main narrative follows Jim, and when he arrived. The head had been cut off before Jim arrived, so the past perfect is appropriate. We could simple describe the body here (He found a headless body, for example), but the past perfect framing of the action brings to mind what happened here – that this was a scene actively created by someone or something.
This use of the past perfect helps put the subject in a situation before revealing past information that sets the scene. It can establish past events, and add details which were not important enough to explain earlier, or it can help put events in order of discovery for the subject (for instance for tension).
- We were talking for hours before I realised we had dated the same circus performer.
- I walked into the shop and immediately ordered the lemon cake. I had already decided that it was a day for lemon.
- Juliet went into the pantry and was devastated to find that someone had devoured all the croissants.
- The children opened the door and searched for a light. They flicked the switch, but nothing happened. Someone had removed the bulb.
As a narrative becomes more complex, and you add style to your English writing, the use of the past perfect becomes rather flexible. For example, you may choose to use the past simple after the past perfect has been used once, rather than repeat it.
- She had been to this area before. It was deserted, that time. There were no people, and certainly no cars. Now, it was vibrant and noisy.
The past simple may also be used instead of the past perfect to represent the subject’s point of view.
- He wondered if buying this house had been a bad idea.
- He wondered if buying the house was a bad idea.
Both of these sentences could be seen as correct, though the past perfect emphasises the idea happened before; the past simple version, however, puts us more in the subject’s point of view, making the bad idea seem much more immediate. This is not a hard rule and requires practice to set the scene correctly, but once you start thinking about it, you’ll find all sorts of ways to adapt the past perfect.Besiktas president Fikret Orman has warned interested Premier League clubs over their price for Cenk Tosun.
Tottenham, Newcastle, Crystal Palace and Everton are all keen on Tosun, with talk of a bid of €20m being mentioned.
“There's no figure for him," Orman told NTV Spor.
“These players are like my children – I have an interest in their careers. They aren't machines. (Kylian) Mbappe went to Paris Saint-Germain for €180m (£158.5m), (Naby) Keita for €70 (£61.7m) or €80m (£70.5m), so placing a higher value than €20m on Tosun is not crazy.
“If Mbappe had played for Besiktas, would PSG have paid that amount? We need to raise the brand value of Turkish football."

This letter is in response to Karl Jost’s interview with CBC Radio on Nov.26/13.
While I respect Mr. Josts’ right to express his opinions I am taking him to task on his comment – that the reason that there is resistance to Kovach Park as the site of the new skateboard is that 6-8 neighboring people think that skateboarders are just a bunch of punks.
I am totally shocked that as a representative of the CVSA he would stoop to the lowest level and make this issue very personal, so much for integrity.
The residents of South Revelstoke under the generous leadership of C. Pearce who put together public meetings to help CVSA find a home brought much input from South Revelstoke residents and many others. Many options were looked at; some dismissed quickly others requiring more info. In the end it appeared that Centennial Park was the likely front runner.
The foot dragging by the City soon became evident. The questions of ground stability became the flavor of the month.
The world of geo tech was added to the mix, the placement of uncontrolled fill was the next buzz statement and on and on.
While I sense the CVSA’s frustration they are focusing on the wrong group. The City needs to step up and take some heat. Their Director of Engineering is the one making these statements yet tell me why it was okay for the City to spend +/- $250,000 on the new washrooms at Centennial Park on top off the old landfill.
Look at the old pictures of the Rec Center area and you will see a very large ravine. Don’t tell me that the entire fill was a “controlled fill” or why is it when you dig down 12 feet on the back right-hand corner of the Rec Center you will find cedar shavings of an undetermined depth. Why is okay to build a pool on an old uncontrolled fill yet when it comes to the skateboard park all the rules are dragged out?
In the world of high-strength concrete and re-inforcing the skateboard park is like a swimming pool. It may move but if done right it moves as one.
Kovach Park has been evolving over the last decade. It is the entrance to the much used Greenway it houses a small half-court basketball area. It has a young children’s area mostly devoid of any play equipment (anyone good at writing grant applications – contact me). It will soon be home to a seniors’ exercisie area and a little green space to play fetch with Rover and the kids.
The neighborhood welcomed the zoning change to allow Begbie Manor to add an additional 16 homes for seniors. Its time for some other area of town to step up to the plate and provide different venues for the youth of Revelstoke. Kovach Park has more than done its fair share. While it does contain the old outdated skateboard park which serves the little ones well, it is not the site for the new hi-tech park. It seems like Kovach Park is becoming the dumping ground for all good things.
Mr. Jost your comments where totally out of line you owe the 6-8 an apology. I will continue to be supportive of your endeavor because I believe in your cause but will always take you to task on comments like those made on CBC Radio
Bob Melnyk
Revelstoke, BC
Click here to listen to the comments made on CBC Radio.
sorry for my late response as i was out of town for a couple days…
The truth is there was negative comments towards skateboarders as a group in letters sent to council as Matt has shown examples. I was being honest in my comments and i will always be honest. I am disappointed Bob, in you questioning my integrity. I am not one to hold back information. If anyone wrote a letter without siting negative comments towards skateboarders i will definitely apologize. To anyone who did, i would love to discuss this in person to hopefully show you this is not the case with skateboarders. We are people like anyone else pursuing a sport we love. I mean no offense to anyone with this next comment, but the reality is there are people who act improperly in all walks of life and in all sports. Why is it skateboarders are singled out? A couple “misbehaviour’s” does not define an entire sport.
I will get straight to the point here. We have done years of leg work looking at locations and trying to find the best suitable place for the new youth park (as it should have always been called as the user groups range from skateboarders, rollerbladers, scooterers, bmx and mountain bikers, even to young children who like to run around in the park as a younger parent recently told me).
Centennial had become an option but due to newly arising factors, may not work at all. Spending tax payers money on geo-tech surveys that will at the very least delay this project for a minimum of a couple years (to several) seems to make no sense on a “maybe” location. If the ground shifts, sure the concrete will be strong but these types of parks are very dependent on the proper angles to function correctly. Shifting may cause the park to become “sub par” due to changing angles. This is one example of what can go wrong, creating a huge liability and waste of money.
Kovach park has housed a skate park for many many years. This park (with the addition of washrooms now slated in the budget) will be for the entire city of Revelstoke to enjoy. I have people ask me daily why the park is not off the ground yet. There is huge support for this project and will be such a positive thing for the youth of this city. The fact of the matter is if Kovach is not the chosen location for the park, it may squash the project completely, depriving many people and kids of an amazing piece of infrastructure that exists in almost every little town to big city in B.C. If kovach is chosen it may also solve the location problem for the pump track/dirt jumps as the centennial park area would work great for it. Because it will be made of dirt, ground shifting is not an issue and a geo-tech survey should not be required.
Jeff i appreciate your comments and really hope to have this built sooner than later so you and your friends have a great place to spend your time biking. I have watched the skateboard population grow in town over the last seven years i have been here. It’s great as well to watch guys like Taylor Roberts skate the park, then hop on a bike and send some airs over the bank. Revelstoke has such a high population of active kids who participate in a few of these sports rather than one. this park will be a benefit to all user groups. Keep shredding it Jeff and we’ll keep working hard until a new park is a reality.
Rem, i just wanted to touch quickly on your worry of a “code of conduct” for the park. With the construction of a new park, signage is very important. parks these days are almost always accompanied by signs outlying the park code of conduct, requirements and hours of operation (usually 7am-dusk). We as an association, but more importantly as skateboarders ourselves will do our very best to watch over the park, it’s users, and teach the proper ethics that go with it.
I have posted a link to the CVSA facebook page where i will be putting up a couple pictures I took of the Peachland skate park that backs directly onto houses and their sign. You can see examples for yourself and also how nice, clean and cool new skate parks look these days.
I think Matt has done a great job with his writing and covered the issues very well. Matt thanks for responding.
Karl Jost
I sorta have to wonder out loud on this..with all the mountain trails and openness surrounding the city..why are bikers wasting their time on a man made area..and for skate boarders..why don’t they start a club and themselves police the area with their own set of rules for use..maybe organize tournaments if that is right word..get them involved more..with a little responsibility thrown at them..I am sure things would be fine..
Matt
Your a right to call me on singling out the skaters as the ones responsible for the behaviour I have had to deal with and I apologizes for it. I should have related this behaviour to users of the Kovach Park Skatepark.
I would also like to thank you for publicly naming those of us who have stated our concerns with the redevelopment of the newly named youth park (less controversial than skatepark). I believe there are others who are also not in favour of the CVSA redevelopment plans.
As you indicated we should do, I did a bit of research on “youth parks” and found the vast majority (all but maybe two) were not anywhere near residential neighbourhoods. I do agree this type of development does have its benefits but also has negatives. As a person who has Kovach Park as a neighbour, I get to witness both. I may just be being selfish, but I agree with the SNG and would prefer to go with the Site plan developed for Kovach park.
Miles
Rem, what I expect from the neighbors of Kovach is to portray a realistic picture of the parks users. One thing we can all agree on is that we love Kovach Park, it is the reason we’re all fighting so hard for it. Most of the people that are opposed to the Youth Park redevelopment have stated that they like the current Youth Park. It is to stay in place as part of the new development in Kovach that the neighbors worked on with the seniors’ equipment and picnic table upgrades.
What is being overlooked is that the current Youth Park and its users are part of what makes Kovach a great place. As a homeowner in that area for the last 8 years I know, and you know that the majority of the Youth Park users right now are an enjoyable bunch of kids that have a lot of good clean fun there. I have never seen anything at Kovach that I felt disturbing or required a police presence.
The behavior that has been mentioned by some neighbors has been cherry picked from rare incidents that happen occasionally at all city parks. To me this is painting an unrealistic picture of Kovach Park’s users.
The misconception is that this user group is going to change for the worse with a better Youth Park. It is not. To answer your question to whether the CVSA is going to offer some sort of commitment to honor a code of conduct? Absolutely we will. As individuals using the park we will take appropriate action if we witness unwanted behaviors, as should every user of Kovach Park. This is how we keep it the park we all know and love today.
We all agree that washroom facilities are a must for Kovach whether there’s a redeveloped Youth Park or not. As for the city, we have expressed our frustration with the process in our latest letter to council. We can all agree on this point. But spending the money on Centennial is not what we feel is best for the community or this project. Our original plan was always Kovach for this redevelopment. However after our meeting with the Southside Neighborhood Group years ago we all agreed that there needed to be washroom facilities. Now there are washroom facilities in the budget, and with the ground stability issues at Centennial, simply redeveloping the already existing park makes perfect sense.
Sure the city has made this process frustrating, however if not for the 7 people that oppose this park in Kovach they would be in a much easier position to approve it and move on.
Jeff, I thank you very much for joining in on the conversation. You are very well spoken and make a great point that this park has a diverse user group. We look forward to hearing you and your friends input when it comes to the design phase. Thanks!

Even as a BMXer, all these sly comments about skateboarders are a total joke and make me very upset! …Im not even a skateboarder and I can tell you they’re false. I ride my bike with my friends almost everyday in Kovach park. A lot of times it is only us bikers there. What no one is saying is that the actual skateboard population in Revelstoke is much smaller than us on bikes. We are the ones that use the park more than the skateboarders! …I can’t thank the CVSA enough for being the ones to get organized and work their asses off for us. Everyone always loves to single out the skateboarders and focus on them as a “problem” …The fact of the matter is that Kovach is used by more of us on bikes than skateboards. Wake up Kovach neighbors!! and stop picking on the skateboarders, the rest of us suffer …I wish that the people against the park would just look across the street sometime and notice that it is used more by us than skateboarders ….Everyone in my school is so excited about getting a new park. Believe me when I say that I can speak for all the bikers in town, we thank the CVSA for trying to build a park for all of us to enjoy! Keep up the good work.
Matt
You have chosen to use three families who live in close proximity to the park as examples, which is fair, but how are they to portray what they witness over and over? Their names are on public record expressing their observations. They did not name the CVSA directly for a reason. The City has been of no help dealing with the issues they have chosen not to even post a closing time in the park so the RCMP have very little that they can do. The park does not even have washroom facilities and it was bumped from the budget once already and with the current budget fiasco I am not so sure it won’t be bumped again. I feel that the radio time was intended to invoke sympathy for this project. Am I to take from your letter that the CVSA is prepared to offer some sort of commitment to honor a code of conduct? The comment about Centennial Park being unstable may hold some truth, but I would not bet the bank on Kovach Park. Is the City Engineer going to sign off on the ground stability when he has no idea how large the excavations were in the park during the construction of the South Revelstoke sewer or how they were backfilled? I still stand by my original letter. I continue to try and be supportive of the cause but Kovach with the little kids’ area the new seniors’ areas as well as the gateway to the Greenway is enough for a small park.
Bob, you have always been cordial to us and have not been negative to our group or other skateboarders, however the other letters and conversations we’ve had with some of the other 6 people that oppose the renovation to the Youth Park in Kovach have been exactly what Karl has described. Example…
“I also do not want to stereotype about “skate boarders”. However, the reality is that I do live directly across from the skateboard park and have made some real observations in the relatively short time that we have lived here. In general the biking population that uses the skate board facilities that currently exist act in a much different fashion than the skate boarding population using those same facilities. As a resident that is regularly indirectly affected by the swearing, yelling, dope smoking, and other inappropriate public park behaviour (often late in the evening) that is clearly associated with skate board population I certainly have a hard time getting excited about expanding these facilities to encourage more skate board users.”
Pat McMechan
Sent to council for the Oct. 8th agenda
“My reasons for no expansion are basic. Skateboarding is usually done by teenagers young and old.Foul language, smoking, drinking ,partying and bullying have been some of the behaviours I have witnessed.”
Bonnie Teed
Sent to council for the Oct. 8th agenda
“I do not believe a new larger skateboard park that draws in more of teens and young adults will make the park an inviting place for young families and seniors. The reason I feel this way is that just over a week ago I had the unwanted privilege of listening to very loud music full of profanity over a couple hour period. The screaming, yelling and profanity that comes from the skaters at the park is unwanted. There will only be more if a larger skateboard park is built.”
Miles Howard
Sent to council for the Oct. 8th agenda
As a person who grew up playing hockey, baseball, basketball, volleyball and skateboarded I can tell you that the issues described above are social issues, not skateboard issues. A new park is not going to multiply these behaviors that our neighbors describe, I know first hand. Years ago I was a Youth Facility Manager for the city of Banff managing the local skateboard park. I can tell you from experience, the majority of users of a skateboard park in towns like ours are little ones and families. This demographic will not change, this park is for them. The current park is not little one friendly and discourages the potential for young kids and families to safely have fun there. The asphalt is not smooth; there is no flow and very few features to keep kids interested.
I can also tell you that skateboard tourists are few and far between. Although a few will come and skate, and spend money they are not going to overtake our park.
The fear that this new park will bring in a demographic that will “ruin” our neighborhood is simply false. I say “our” because I own a home one block away. Not only will a new design to the current park make Kovach a better place for the youths, families, and elderly people of Revelstoke, it will alleviate the current social problems that have been witnessed there, by responsible users that care about the park and keep the peace and order.
As for Centennial park, the fact is, the cost of building a Youth Facility there WILL cost the taxpayers of Revelstoke $100 000 or more. The town is looking to spend municipal funds to conduct a geotechnical survey there to get results that are right in front of our faces. The ground is unstable. Once the town spends that money to find out the ground is unstable, it will be up to us as a volunteer group to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars on top of the cost of a Youth Park, and put the project years away from even starting to raise funds. This could squash the project completely.
I am begging the 7 people that have fought the redevelopment of the Youth Park in Kovach, to visit another town of similar size, that have a new skateboard/youth facility. Ask them what it has done for their community. Visit their facility’s to see the user groups. Ask the police if those facilities have a drug/alcohol or a criminal element. Please make phone calls to these communities, do an internet search to find these answers. I guarantee you will find overwhelmingly positive answers.
When this community gets the park that it has shown it wants you will see first hand how positive it is, as I have seen in my experience.
To the community members that have had a positive experience at Kovach Park’s Youth Facility, please show your support for its redevelopment by going to the Columbia Valley Skateboard Association’s Facebook page. Copy and paste the letter we have posted, or better yet, send your own personal feedback and positive experiences to city council. Send it to the email addresses we have listed on facebook.
Thanks

- From the Why to the How
- Who Should Attend
- Created by Pioneers Representing All Aspects of Business
- Faculty
Enterprise Engagement is an emerging field that focuses on achieving financial success by fostering the proactive involvement of all people critical to that success by and integrating all of the levers of engagement to maximize alignment.
Headed up by Enterprise Engagement faculty leaders Gary Rhoads, Professor of Marketing and Entrepreneurship at the Marriott School of Business at Brigham Young University, and Allan Schweyer, Curriculum Director for the Enterprise Engagement Alliance, the intensive, two-day program will focus specifically on the definition, science and economics of Enterprise Engagement. The sessions will also provide preparation for the Certified Engagement Professional program.
Employee and customer engagement are among the hottest topics in business today, as more and more companies seek to improve performance through better relationships with customers, distribution partners, employees and communities. Recent moves by leading investor groups and international standards organizations are now putting increasing pressure on large corporations to adopt and report on formal engagement strategies. See the following articles from Engagement Strategies Media: Professor Stefanie Becker Says Human Capital and Engagement Are Worldwide Issues and $2.6 Trillion Investor Coalition Sees Link Between Human Capital Management and Shareholder Return.
Further driving demand for education in this field are new standards being developed by the International Standardization Organization for employee engagement likely to be included in future versions of ISO 9001 quality standards.
This new focus on engagement across the enterprise is driving demand for a new level of expertise among executives in sales, marketing, human resources, finance and general management. The Engagement U. education program is specifically designed to help executives at all levels gain a rapid grasp of this powerful new business field through information-packed sessions, roundtable discussions and opportunities to meet with experts in all areas of engagement in unique, interactive format.
The program will also include a special track for engagement solution providers seeking to profit from this new field, as well as preparation for the Certified Engagement Professional online test.
Registration for the event will open shortly. For more information, contact:

This conference is designed to take attendees beyond the why to the how by providing both a scientific and experience-based roadmap for identifying the key audiences and levers needed to be addressed to focus people’s passions and skills on the most critical organizational values and goals.
More and more corporations are sending out RFPs seeking engagement solutions or putting people in charge of engagement initiatives without having a clear framework for what is required to achieve results by better engaging customers, distributor partners, employees, vendors and communities.
- Corporate management responsible for achieving critical sales, marketing and human resources goals.
- CEOs and management involved with sales, marketing and program design at solution providers in all areas of engagement, from leadership training and communications to innovation and analytics.
This educational program is unique in that it was created starting over eight years ago by a community of academics, corporate executives, and engagement solution providers who believe that engagement is a process like any other in business and requires agreed upon nomenclature, an overall framework, and a formal process for organizations to generate measurable benefits.
The EEA curriculum authors analyzed dozens of studies and collaborated with dozens of experts, to develop a formal process that takes engagement beyond ad hoc niceties to include:
- A formal Engagement business plan with clear goals, objectives, strategies, and measures.
- A clear understanding of the audience, be it consumers; distribution partners; sales, operational or administrative employees; vendors, or communities and how they can affect performance.
- A plan to address all of the appropriate levers of engagement in a strategic way, including culture, brand, leadership at all levels, communication, learning, collaboration and innovation, analytics, and more.
Presenters will include the co-authors and editors of the first formal curriculum on Enterprise Engagement, first created in 2008 and significantly enhanced since then, along with leading corporate practitioners and expert engagement solution providers.Paul Ryan: An Interesting Choice
My original column for this week started with, “My head is hurting.” The subject, and what was causing the headache, was the lies, misleading sound bites and vituperative remarks that have, until now, characterized the current political campaign for president.
Once one starts down any path, whether it be accepting the sight of “rear-end” cracks in public, public display of affection, rudeness as a virtue, or just plain meanness, it seems to grow like a snowball going downhill. It appears to me that this has happened in terms of the ugliness and irrelevance of political campaigning.
One might as well watch “Real New Jersey Housewives” to find out the state of the issues facing this country as to watch political ads.
Not only that, but, once an ad has been “outed” by fact checkers as false, it continues to run. Think of the Bain Capital ads, for example. How the guy who saved Staples has ruined the lives of workers….
Presidential candidate Mitt Romney may have just made an attempt to turn this around with the nomination of Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin for vice president. If he really means, as he says he does, to turn this race from manure slinging to issue discussion, we owe him a debt of gratitude.
Mr. Romney may have also done something else that’s extraordinary. He may have paid the American people a huge compliment by respecting them enough to believe that they will be able to find the truth through the smokescreen that is covering this nation.
Maybe he’s just doing it because he doesn’t think he can win the “manure” war that is going on.
Maybe he really wants to create a campaign of issues, and believes the American people are smart enough to understand the real ones.
Looking through AOL’s “news stories” around midday Tuesday, there were two mentions of Paul Ryan. The first headline used the words, “Bad News.” Under that headline was a meaningless report comparing the number of people who today think Mr. Ryan is an asset to the campaign with the number who felt that way about vice presidential candidates at this point in prior elections.
The second was a piece discussing Bristol Palin’s view of Congressman Ryan. Bristol is going to be praying for Mr. Ryan and his family because they are in for the most difficult 90 days of their lives. Wonder what would make her think that.
I guess these stories give you AOL’s slant on Paul Ryan. Conveniently located on about the same page was an opportunity to wish President Barack Obama a happy birthday.
Of course, there’s been a lot of other talk since the Veep nomination, and more manure slinging. One of my personal favorites is the assertion that Congressman Ryan’s budget would destroy Medicare, and turn it into a voucher system, throwing grandma out of her wheelchair, so to speak.
Mr. Ryan says that his proposal was intended to save Medicare, by changing the present system for future retirees now under the age of 55, in order to insure that there are enough funds to provide the medical care already promised to seniors beyond that age. He said it would be completely unfair to deny them the benefits promised to them, since they planned their retirements around them.
Mr. Ryan is said to be very intelligent and a good guy. He is called by Paul Gigot, Wall Street Journal’s editorial page editor, a member of the Reform Wing of the Republican Party. Mr. Gigot stated on Monday’s “Opinion Journal” that Paul Ryan has helped to clarify Mitt Romney’s campaign in a more positive light for many voters, and that he has influenced former Massachusetts Governor Romney behind the scenes to clarify his positions on Medicare and tax reform.
Other opinions include that Mr. Ryan is a Tea Party ideologue, a perfect leader for the racist, homophobic, extreme right wingers who want to hurt the poor in this country.
Paul Ryan has a public reputation as a conservative. Among thinking people, he is considered intelligent, serious, thoughtful and charismatic, an experienced, effective congressman. If nothing else, he was willing to take the political risk of making a counter proposal to the president’s budget, one that aimed to move in the direction of lowering debt, and moving in the direction of balance.
Still, he could be either a risky choice politically for Governor Romney, or one that offers us hope, whatever the outcome, of an issues-based campaign. Nothing could be more needed at such a crucial time.
Do we have the guts to vote for two white guys?Lisa Y.

In 2000, Tom Poole, a West Virginia University School of Medicine graduate, created an endowment in memory of Dr. Daniel Watts, his mentor, friend, and founder of the WVU pharmacology program.
Since initially giving $100,000 to the Dan Watts Endowment for Pharmacological Research and Education, Poole and his wife, Kay, have included an additional $1 million in their estate plan for the endowment.
Poole and Watts first met at WVU after Poole returned from serving at the Army Hospital in Fort Jackson, S.C. He wished to continue his pre-med studies at WVU with a plan to enter medical school. At the time, Dr. Watts had been hired to build a pharmacology program at WVU.
“He knew I was a poor country boy and that medical school would be an expensive proposition,” Poole said of Watts.
“I was making 50 cents an hour and my wife was pregnant. Dr. Watts asked if I would be interested in a yearlong research fellowship which paid $300 a month. That was more money than I’d ever made,” he said, “I accepted after talking with Kay. That’s when I really got to know him.”
The two would go on to conduct research and publish several articles in scientific journals related to their findings – and become very close friends.
One day Tom had his feet up on a desk. “Dr. Watts walked in and saw the holes in my shoes and asked, “Is that the best pair you have?” I said, “Not only are they my best, they’re the only ones I have. The next day he gave me a pair of his shoes.”
Dr. Watts was one of Poole’s professors when he was accepted to medical school the following year, and became a trusted mentor. After his rotations, Poole interned in Obstetrics at Memorial Hospital in Charleston. Poole opened his own private practice following his work there. Obstetricians Bob Stone and Jack Chambers were two of his close, professional colleagues throughout his career.
Dr. Watts passed away in 1994 at the age of 77, having served as a WVU faculty member from 1953 to 1966.
Now in retirement, the Pooles spend much of their free time completing 5Ks, 10Ks, marathons, and cross-country bike tours.

Amina had been badly beaten during a forced marriage to Mustapha Kellak, a man who had raped her. Although there have been some limited legal improvement in the position of women in Morocco, the state still allows a rapist to marry an underage victim as a way of avoiding prosecution. The law — known as Article 475 — says a “kidnapper” of a minor can marry his victim so that dishonour is not brought on her family.
Legislation designed to outlaw all forms of violence against women, planned since 2006, has yet to appear.
Amina’s parents say a local court pressured them to accept the marriage. They are from a backward, conservative rural area.
On 17 March several hundred women’s rights activists demonstrated in the Moroccan capital, Rabat, demanding that the man who raped Amina be jailed and that Article 475 be abolished. Outrage continued after the Al-Massae newspaper invited the rapist to discuss the matter at a conference in Casablanca.
Eric Goldstein from Human Rights Watch says that many other barriers to equality persist in the Moroccan legal code, including a provision that makes it a crime to give refuge to married women who have escaped their husbands.
Another article in the code makes sex outside of marriage a crime. If a woman reports a rape, and she doesn’t prove her case, she is then admitting to sex outside marriage, opening up the possibility of prosecution.
Women’s rights in Morocco are becoming a battleground between liberals and the left, and the Islamists who have been brought to power in the wake of the Arab Spring.
To head off a revolution, the King made concessions and allowed the formation of a government led by the Islamist Justice and Development Party. Bassima Hakkaoui, minister of women and the family — and the only woman among the 29 ministers in the government — acknowledged that there was a “real problem” and called for a debate on changing the law. But Hakkaoui also claimed that Amina Filali had consented to the marriage.
And Justice Minister El Mostafa Ramid denied Amina Filali had been raped.
17-year-old Layla Belmahi, a founder of a women’s rights group denounced the Minister:
“He was talking about it like it was something that was normal, that the only thing that really shocked him was the fact that she killed herself.
“The problem wasn’t the fact that she killed herself. It was that she was forced to marry her rapist.”
Two Tunisian bloggers, Jabeur Mejri and Ghazi Beji, have been given long prison sentences after they posted a cartoon of Muhammad on Facebook.
Ghazi Beji is still being looked for by police, while Jabeur Mejri faces seven years in jail.
On Sunday 25 March 10,000 marched in the capital, Tunis, demanding the country introduce Islamic sharia law. The ultra-conservative Salafists are pressing the leading party in the government, Ennahda, a somewhat milder Islamist party, to make the changes. Some marchers demanded a war on Jews – alarming Tunisia’s Jews, a 1500 minority among a population of ten million.
Also last month, Salafist students at Manouba University on the outskirts of Tunis fought secular students and burnt the Tunisian flag.
Last year, Salafists protested outside Nessma TV when it screened the French-Iranian film Persepolis. They also attacked a cinema that was showing “Ni Dieu, Ni Maitre,” (“No God, No Master”), a film by secularist filmmaker Nadia al-Fani. Some Salafists were jailed.
Ennahda, which won 41% of the seats in the constituent assembly elected last October, declares that the new constitution will not base Tunisia’s law on sharia.
The Islamists have not gone uncontested. A large march took place in Tunis to celebrate International Women’s day.
On Monday 9 April 2000 protesters marching from the nearby headquarters of the main trade union federation, the UGTT, which has been at the forefront of opposition to the Islamist-led government, fought riot police at the interior ministry on Bourguiba Avenue.
On Saturday 7 April the police had attacked and dispersed a march by jobless workers in central Tunis and the unions were demanding their right to protest.Video: Oxnard power plant protest

FIFA president Sepp Blatter refused to rule out a re-run of the 2022 World Cup bid vote if bribery allegations are proven after announcing to Zurich to testify in person but would not be drawn on the possibility of a re-vote taking place.
He said: “This is an idea circulating already around the world which is alarming. But don’t ask me now yes or no, let us go step by step. It’s like we are in an ordinary court and in an ordinary court we cannot ask: ‘if, if,. (Eurosport)
Could it really happen? Is the FIFA chief ready to admit failings to the point that he would instigate a new round of voting? If so, would Qatar be able to take part? Would such a re-run also occur for the 2018 vote which has also been tarnished with allegations of alleged bribery?
It could be that Mr. Blatter knows he has to be on his best (least mad) behaviour in the run up to the presidential election next month, after which he will revert back to the mad scientist approach he has adopted for the best part of 14 years.

Arguments
argument
The argument of a callback routine. (This is not a string that contains the name of the argument but the argument itself.) (a or n)
new_value
The new value to be assigned to that argument. (a or n)
Discussion
All arguments that are passed to a bound callback routine are read‑only and cannot be modified directly. Usually this situation presents no problems, because most callbacks that are defined by ActiveX controls either have no parameters or, if they do have parameters, the parameters are for information access only. Some ActiveX controls, however, require that information be returned to them by one or more callback parameters. In this case, you can use AX_NEWVAL.
Note that argument differs from the other name parameters in the ActiveX API, which specify the name as a string. For example, suppose you have the numeric argument level defined for a callback routine. To change the value to 5, you might use the following call:
xcall ax_newval(level, 5)
but not <![CDATA[ ]]>
xcall ax_newval("level", 5)
Any parameter modifications made by AX_NEWVAL are not returned to the calling ActiveX control until the callback routine returns.
If you call AX_NEWVAL for something that passes a VT_BSTR argument, the length of the string changes to the length of new_value. AX_NEWVAL may also change the data type of an argument if the ActiveX control defines the argument as VT_VARIANT. Variant data types must be passed by reference.
We recommend that you XCALL AX_NEWVAL instead of accessing it as a function.The.)..

Blowjob
To spit or swallow, that is the question.
It’s debatable what would be the most fantasized sexual act for a man – being on the receiving end of a blowjob or a threesome. I’d have to say the blow job would come out on top.
A blowjob – or as it’s known by the proper term, fellatio – is the act of performing oral sex on a man. Giving head, sucking off – whatever you call it – is often seen as a chore by women, but can be pleasurable to both. In The Wives, book 3 in my Husbands and Wives series, Melissa discovers how much fun giving a blow job can be. Melissa enlists Jacey’s help to perfect the art of the blowjob, using Joe as a guinea pig.
There are proper techniques, which I will NOT be discussing, but can involve, lips, tongue, teeth, cupping, sucking and licking. As I sit drinking my tea, I’ve just learned the term tea bag which is the oral stimulation of the scrotum. Also, did you know that fruit bats engage in fellatio during mating?
Like many sexual acts, there are many negative connotations about blow jobs. It’s an intimate act and everyone has their own preferences, wants and desires.Find 24554 historical societies.

Tara Brown-Ogilvie, Cohort 2 Scholar
Photo of Tara Brown-Ogilvitanding on a platform in front of a power point projected on a screen behind her. She is wearing a black dress, purple scarf, and black heels while speaking to an audience with a power point clicker in her hand. The power-point encompasses the University of Northern Colorado (UNC) colors in gold and blue. With text that reads, Perceived Needs in Deafblindness: Participant Quote..."I don't expect that they're going to give us a formula in our university programs, but we need enough experience and exposure to feel comfortable with our own professional judgement" with a NLCSD logo in the upper right hand corner.
Attending the International Mobility Conference (IMC), I was able to share space with some of the greatest minds in Orientation and Mobility (OMS). I personally love to see how OMS, professors, and agencies across the world are handling the same issues that we are experiencing in the United States. The highlights for me being a workshop on working with blind or visually impaired students who are also wheelchair users, a lecture on cane identification for travelers who are deafblind, and the opportunity to present on a pilot study conducted at the University of Northern Colorado (UNC) with Dr. Silvia Correa-Torres. Entitled, Perceived Needs of Orientation & Mobility Specialists Who Work with Individuals Who Are Deafblind.
As I had not had the opportunity to attend a workshop by the eminent Scott Crawford on his techniques for working with wheelchair mobility, I was ecstatic to learn everything I could from him for myself and my colleagues. As participants, we were able to be both the student and the instructor to experience both manual and power wheelchairs. Practicing techniques that could apply to students with low vision, blindness, along with dual sensory loss. In conclusion of the session, we were given Scott Crawford contact information, which I feel is an invaluable resource for serving students with complex needs in the future.
For the session on identification for travelers who are deafblind, a representative from ONCE spoke of a long cane with double red and white stripes in Spain to identify individuals with dual sensory loss. However, a point was made that although the cane may be created, but was there enough awareness for it to be effective? The reply was of course that it is a process in the making, that awareness activities had taken place, but not to the extent of creating nationwide awareness yet in Spain. To this topic, I inquired as to creating awareness through driver licensing programs. As in the United States, the “white cane law” is often learned through a state’s driver manual, so why not add a page on canes for those who are deafblind as a way to educate a large majority of the nation’s population? This idea was seen as very interesting and perhaps a project for the future.
Lastly, the twenty-minute oral presentation discussed the aforementioned qualitative study which involved interviewing OMS about their experiences and perceived needs when working with students who are deafblind in order to provide implications for graduate orientation and mobility programs. At the time of the conference, eight OMS were recruited for 30-45 minute phone interviews. These interviews were then transcribed verbatim, organized with NVivo 11 software, and analyzed using a constant comparison method to identify key themes as well as extract salient participant quotes. The presentation itself was well received and it was a great experience to speak on an international platform about the needs in the fields of deafblindness that seemed to resonate with the international audience. As a result, I now feel more encouraged to continue working with Dr. Silvia Correa-Torres in expanding the study to 15 participants with hopes to present a poster at the 2017 Deafblind International conference in Denmark.
-- Tara Brown-OgilvieRyan Eggold will be returning to the latest season of “The Blacklist” after the cancellation of the show’s sequel “The Blacklist: Redemption” after one season. The actor, who played Tom Keen, was an original cast member of the mother series. After the third season, he left to star in the spinoff.
NBC announced the renewal of “The Blacklist” for a fifth season just last month. Its sequel “The Blacklist: Redemption” focused on Tom Keen and his mother Scottie (Famke Janssen). She ran a private military corporation of covert mercenaries.
According to “The Blacklist” spoilers for the new season, Red (James Spader) will do everything he can to prevent Liz (Megan Bone) from getting the mysterious suitcase. Cartermatt reports that relationships will be severed once the suitcase from the farm reaches its intended recipient.
In last season’s finale of “The Blacklist,” Tom was on his way to deliver the suitcase to Liz upon the instruction of Mr. Kaplan (Susan Blommaert). Liz still had no idea what Tom was up to since she was still reeling from the revelation that Red was her biological father. While everyone thought that the mystery to Liz’ identity has been cleared, Red turned up at the farm with Dembe (Hisham Tawfiq) reports Entertainment Weekly.
The two men discovered that the suitcase which was supposed to be buried has disappeared and they were only left with a gaping hole. Viewers would later learn in “The Blacklist” season finale that the suitcase contained pieces of skeleton. Although it was not revealed whose skeletal remains they were, it is apparent that the person was an important part in red and Liz’ complicated relationship.
Meanwhile, all will not be well between Aram (Amir Arison) and Samar (Mozhan Marno) next season of “The Blacklist.” When last seen, Aram kissed Samar after he was betrayed by his girlfriend Janet ((Annie Heise). But, Samar will continue to have trust issues on Aram because of how he doubted her in the past.
Will Red be able to stop Tom from delivering the suitcase to Liz in time? Whose skeleton pieces are inside it? Find out when the new season of “The Blacklist” premieres in the fall.© 2018 Mstars News, All rights reserved.

TEMPE, Ariz. -- “They’re a very, very good football team. They know their identity. They figured it out in a hurry.”
A quick scan of the numbers back up Todd Graham's assessment of the Oregon State Beavers.
And then some.
Mike Riley's squad likes to pass the ball first, pass it again second, and then pass some more for good measure.
Coming into this Saturday's battle with Arizona State in Tempe, the Beavers rank third nationally in passing yards (3,643) and fifth in attempts (449). On the flip side, only two teams in the FBS have run it fewer times than Oregon State's 235 attempts (and 19 of those attempts have been sacks).
Those figures paint a pretty clear picture of what to expect for an Arizona State's defense that is rolling after another strong showing last Saturday in the 20-19 win over Utah.
The Sun Devils held the Utes to just 247 yards of offense—with only 121 through the air—continuing a stretch of excellent performance in recent weeks. Over the last four games, ASU's opponents have averaged just 257 yards of offense per game, and after the two-game road swing, the Sun Devil defense is looking forward to coming back to Tempe.
“We play really well at home, so we are excited about that," said ASU cornerback Osahon Irabor. "We understand that they have a very dynamic receiver and a very good passing offense with the quarterback-to-receiver combination. We have a pretty good pass defense, so we’re looking to keep that up.”
ASU now ranks 19th in the nation in pass defense, allowing just over 206 yards per game. While the team's pass rush has been a major factor, contributing 17 sacks over the last four games, the players in the secondary have also stepped up their play during that span.
Along with known commodities in Irabor and safety Alden Darby, other players have emerged, principally cornerbacks Robert Nelson and Lloyd Carrington. Nelson in particular has been a ballhawk, collecting three interceptions over the last four games, helping to put early season struggles behind him.
“I always tell Rob, ‘Just keep chipping away. Next play.’ Me and Darby always tell the guys not to let anyone take their confidence," Irabor said. "I think Rob has shown that the last couple of games that he can be the guy to make the play at the end. Nobody was happier for him on that play (Nelson's interception at Utah) than me and Alden, the way we represent the secondary.”
"It shows their maturity and how they’ve been getting to work during practice and seriously they are taking it," Darby added.
The Sun Devil defense will need all those hands on deck and playing their A-games this Saturday night against the Beavers. While Oregon State's run/pass ratio may be similar to prior ASU opponent Washington State's, the offensive scheme differs significantly.
“We’re going to see schemes that are different than what we’ve seen week to week," Graham said.
The Beavers utilize more of a pro-set look in their offense than the Cougars' spread attack, which includes large doses of tight ends and fullbacks. Those personnel packages give the team the flexibility to run a wide variety of plays and feature several players.
“They do a lot: screens, deep passes. They do everything," said Darby. "They are a great passing team, and Brandin Cooks is a great receiver. They do it all and utilize all of their weapons.”
Stopping Cooks is ASU's top priority, and likely priority No. 2 as well.
The 5-foot-10 junior is one of the most electrifying players in the nation, and Oregon State uses him in a variety of ways, including as a runner. Through nine games, Cooks has 91 catches for 1,344 yards and 14 touchdowns, while rushing 23 times for 174 yards and two more touchdowns.
“Dynamic receiver," Irabor said of Cooks. He’s obviously their guy that they want to get the ball to," Irabor said. "He’s dangerous with the ball in his hands."
Graham was much more effusive in his take on Cooks.
"Big play capabilities," Graham said. "He is really special. He is No. 1 statistically in all-purpose yards as well as receiving yards. In my opinion, he is the best receiver I’ve seen on film in this conference."
In a conference with the likes of Marqise Lee, Jaelen Strong, and Dres Anderson, that is high praise indeed.
While Cooks deservedly gets the headlines, ASU can't afford to sleep on the other Beaver options.
Richard Mullaney, playing the X-receiver spot opposite Cooks, is a well-rounded and sure-handed 6-foot-3 target. Running backs Storm Woods and Terron Ward are a threat out of the backfield, having combined for 59 receptions, and 6-foot-7, 265-pound tight end Connor Hamlett is a dangerous redzone threat, with four touchdowns on the year.
While playing a team with such aerial weapons and pass-happy playcalling may force some teams to alter their defensive gameplan, ASU is sticking to their guns.
"We always look at what other teams have done, but we’re also going to do what we do: Attack and get after it," said Graham. "We do plenty without having to do what somebody else is doing.”
Darby shares the same sentiment. “No adjustments. It’s our same gameplan. We don’t let the offense dictate what we do. We’re an attacking style defense, that’s what we do.”
ASU will continue to bring pressure from all angles in an attempt for force quarterback Sean Mannion into mistakes. While a strong-armed signal caller, the 6-foot-5 Mannion is a prototypical pocket passer and is not a threat to leave the pocket.
That pressure from the Sun Devil front seven will mean that the secondary will put greater pressure on the secondary to play well and avoid giving up the big plays that have burned them several times this season.
Doing so comes from both quality scheming and good execution.
“We’re going to minimize risk, because we run a high risk defense," said Graham.
“We must be locked into our coverage play, and be assignment sound and make sure no one is running free downfield," Irabor said. "We need to make sure we communicate. We do a lot of checking on defense, we need to make sure we are locked in and keeping the defense off balance.”
This high-powered battle between a high-flying offense and a stout defense figures to be one of the more entertaining, and important, matchups that ASU will face all season. For the Sun Devils, this is just one more step towards Pasadena in January.
"We all have the same common goal, and that’s to get to the Rose Bowl by any means necessary, no matter who is in our way."

Definitely very cool!
Making treasuries is an activity I enjoy, especially since the advent of the app Treasurybox*; it's something I like to do to relax, and it lets me "collect" without further stuffing my shelves or closet. It benefits other shops, but also tends to benefit my own in the long run, so it's a win-win.
I'll be crazy-busy keeping up with them all this week, and there will be way too many to share here, but I am going to try and highlight some every day. They're too good to keep to myself!
Meanwhile, on the home front, there have been two wildfires in our area over the weekend, with helicopters flying overhead dumping water, with fire crews on the ground working to contain them. Thankfully they've been successful in both cases, but it's terribly dry here and we're all being very careful and alert to potential trouble. While most of the year in the Pacific Northwest it's a definite "feast" where rain is concerned, during the summer months it's more "famine", and this year is the driest I remember since moving here in the mid-1970's.

At a quarter past four
Or, whatever time Accra heralds the night,
When bats at 37 take to flight,
For me, there's not a more beautiful sight
Of creatures, imagined or real,
That lay claim to these glorious skies.
When bats at 37 take to flight,
With fevered screeches that punctuate the night
When by sheer numbers they darken the skies
And, below, people of a superstitious disposition
Can not be bothered,
I am reminded that,
Given enough time all things cease to be strange.
When bats at 37 take to flight,
Devoid of vibrant plumes unlike most things that fly,
Rising like Legion and the hordes of hell,
In defiance of extermination attempts,
Above the Hospital in elusive figurativeness,
Haphazardly, in sync, over constipated traffic
There is not a doubt who owns the peppered night.
When bats at 37 take to flight;
Chale,
Accra, stay by plan.
Accra, stay by plan.
Chale, Accra stay, by plan...

VAM Emerging Markets Growth Fund is an active, earnings growth-oriented approach to emerging markets equities
The long-term case for the Emerging Markets is that they offer superiour demographics relative to Developed Markets. With the right policies, countries with younger and faster growing populations should see similar increases in per capita income growth. Combined with low penetration of various goods and services in many of these markets, this creates an attractive backdrop for domestic-oriented economic growth.
Another benefit for investors is that emerging markets equities have tended to be less correlated with major developed, market-oriented benchmarks and asset classes, thus providing diversification benefits to asset allocating investors.
Finally, the case can be made that Emerging Markets are under-owned by investors. Despite representing a significant part of the global population and global economic activity, stocks domiciled in Emerging Markets represent less than 20% of the world’s equity market capitalisation.
The VAM Emerging Markets Growth Fund is an active, conviction-based, all-capitalisation equity Fund that is generally fully invested in 80 to 140 holdings with position weights generally between 0.5% andune 2007

An airsoft pistol was seized.I love my son. I would take a bullet to the face for him. I wrote “Becoming my father: PART 2,” and I was afraid people didn't like it because it sounded too bitter. So I want you to know that just because I complain about Junior, doesn't mean I don't love the crap out of him. I do, I really do.
That being said, he drives me nuts.
Junior seems to have misunderstood our relationship. All this time we've understood it as parents and child but he seems to think of it as servants and master. He has become so demanding lately. For example, whenever I’m using something he immediately wants it. He comes up and shouts, “Calle oye beep!” which means, “Give that to me now, servant!”
I can be using the TV remote or eating a sandwich and he will inevitably come up and demand whatever I have. He doesn't even really want it, sometimes he'll throw it aside immediately. If don't give it to him, he'll just try to grab it out of my hand. He'll say “Mome mome whoa whoa,” which means, “Why you insolent little dad! Don't you know who I am? I'm The Baby, and I run this whole show. Now gimme that sandwich!”
I'm getting pretty sick of it. One day I was eating some curry and he walked up to me and demanded, “Calle oye beep!”
“Oh no, Junior,” I said. “It's extremely spicy. Not for babies. I'm gonna have to drink, like, seven shots of Maalox just to survive this one bowl.”
“Calle oye beep,” he said sternly.
“Well if you insist...”
OK, I didn't really give it to him, because that would be mean, but oh, how I thought about it. Should I feel guilty about thinking that? I don't. The kid is out of control.
When I'm feeding him, he'll throw a fit if he doesn't think I'm feeding him fast enough. He bosses everyone around. If I take something away from him, he immediately goes boneless and flops around on the floor like a 15-month-old jellyfish. We keep telling him “no,” and it's getting better, but there are moments where I'm like, “Hey, you're kind of a jerk.”
And my wife says, “You can't call our baby a jerk!”
“Even if he is?” I ask in earnest.
“NO!”
(under my breath) “Well he is.”
This is an actual conversation we have had. Sometimes I fearfully wonder: Is this just typical baby stuff? Or is my child just a brat?
I keep thinking that we need to have another kid so Junior can be taken down a peg, but there's got to be an easier way. Perhaps he's just advanced and has hit the Terrible Twos at fifteen months, or maybe it gets worse.
I sure hope not.
Anyone else got a cranky baby, or any tips on how to deal with one? Leave a comment, it's easy!
I don't have kids so I am not sure what's acceptable behavior. I did just get a dog and I swear she tries to play me anytime she gets the opportunity. I am a sucker.
What drives me nuts more than the demanding behavior is the destruction. Just today Max decided to plug a cell phone charger into the USB port and SD card port of my computer. I could not get the computer to even wake up.
And books, books don't stand a chance, he rips pages of his favorite books and then demands that I "fix it". I still don't know how I develope magic powers that enable me to fix everything. Some things are just not fixable!
I have a 19 monther and I'd like to say it's the age. We have encouraged our son to say please when he is demanding stuff. I think it makes him seem a little nicer.
Having recently given birth to another boy I can advise with some experience that having a 2nd child will only make things worse... at least for the first 3 weeks and possibly longer.
Your daddy blogs are so much better than mommy blogs. So sick of "Daughter one is napping, and daughter two is watching Disney, so now Mommy gets to bake cookies and put a roast in the oven for when Daddy get home! I just love quiet afternoons home with my girls while my husband makes all kinds of money that I get to spend on whatever I want!!!!"
Definitely refreshing to read your words, even if they make me want to say encouraging, cheesy things like "this is but a small moment." I imagine the terror our children bring to us is exactly what we did to our parents... one of those the universe needs to be balanced, type things.WWE

For moderate users, running out of battery is no big deal on your S6. It doesn’t hurt when you’re in office or home but things can be pretty irritating when your phone shows that annoying low battery signal in places where you can’t quench the dying battery’s thirst.
Considering all the hi-tech features, sleek and modern design of the S6, most users would say that it is a problem “worth it.” Although there has not been any official fix from the developers yet but digging deep into some of the helpful resources, we have created a list of useful tips that can give few extra hours to your battery…and in most cases, this is all you need.
DID YOU KNOW? Updato offers seamless and guaranteed phone unlocking for any device, carrier and region! It's quick and easy - try it now.
Here you might also like our post “How to Kill & Detect Battery Draining Apps”
1. Wi-Fi Network
If you’re troubled with low battery signals every time, make sure that your Wi-Fi network is set to 2.4 GHz instead of 5GHz. Also, try turning off the Wi-Fi while you’re travelling to prevent your phone from continuing to search for Wi-Fi networks.
2. Smart Network Switch
Make sure that your Smart Switch is off. You can do this by clicking “settings” then “wifi”. Now click on “more” which can be located at the top right of your screen. Simply turn off the Smart Switch here. What it does is it automatically switches you to mobile data in places where Wi-Fi connection is not stable.
3. Wi-Fi Calling
If you’re on a network that supports Wi-Fi calling, it is better to turn the feature off.
4. VoLTE
Some users with heavy smartphone usage say that disabling VoLTE feature from their phones helps in getting the most out of their battery.
5. Get rid of Unwanted Apps
Unwanted apps on your Samsung Galaxy S6 might have no direct link to the battery life but some users have found it useful. Deleting apps like T-Mobile TV or other apps from the carrier are not likely to hurt you but may prove useful for the battery.
6. Cleaning Device Cache
Files just add up and sit nicely in your cache. This may hurt your battery life. It is advisable to clean your device cache every now and then. To do this, hold the power + volume up + home button and wait as your phone gets into boot recovery. Scroll down to select “Wipe Cache Partition” and you’re done.
7. Update
If you have not updated your phone or apps for some time, it is something that you should do now. Some outdated apps and programs can play their part in draining the life out of your battery.

But it appears the crowds were too much of a good thing.
Macy’s credit card payment system buckled due to a higher than anticipated volume of transactions, the retailer said, leading to delays that slowed the checkout process at department stores around the country Friday.
The Cincinnati retailer said in a statement that the issue caused some transactions to take longer to process. Tweets by the department store to customers specified the issue affected credit and gift card transactions.
Macy’s said Friday afternoon that it had “fully resolved today’s system issues” and that it did not anticipate any additional delays.
Customers at the Macy’s at Westside Pavilion said the credit card payment issues forced them to either pay for their purchases with cash or come back at a later time. Amaya, 18, said they just paid cash and left.
Dhruv Iyer, 19, was in line to purchase shirts around 1 p.m. when it became clear that there were payment issues. A cashier told him that the store could put a hold on his card and charge him for his purchase two weeks from now, but Iyer declined. His credit card was eventually cleared.
Macy’s Chief Executive Jeff Gennette told CNBC earlier Friday morning that online and in-store traffic on Thanksgiving and Black Friday were “strong.”
“Good start to the whole Black Friday shopping season,” he said in the CNBC interview.
Macy’s stock closed at $21.07, up 2.1%.

Our media have given over hours and hours to this catastrophe. In fact, conscientious journalists have been so very busy in Texas, they've not been able to attend to the Monsoon deluges across India, Bangladesh and Nepal where over 1,200 people have died. Or to Myanmar where violence has erupted setting off mass migrations.
This manmade cataclysm is causing untold grief and distress. The victims are beleaguered, despised, savagely discriminated against, described by many international aid organisations as the 'among the most persecuted people in the world'. They have been in what was Burma for three generations, but have no rights, no citizenship, no protection under the law.
Should we be asking questions like 'Are Rohingya Muslims On The Path To Extinction?'
Don't ever believe that Buddhists are all calm and humane, their monks, ethereal ascetics in orange. In Myanmar, the serene Buddha's extremist followers have been maltreating and intimidating the Rohingya minority forever. The army turns mortars and machine guns on these defenceless, stateless folk. Their villages are burnt.
India is about to expel the thousands who have fled there. The only place of safety is Bangladesh, a country with few recourses where almost 18,000 have fled to in the last five days. Kofi Anan, the erstwhile UN secretary has warned that the status quo cannot continue. The latest purge came after Rohingya insurgents attacked thirty police stations last Friday, killing 11 people. The state response was swift. The rebels were despatched.
But it didn't end there. Civilians are being collectively punished for the insurgency. On that same Friday, Annan published a report commissioned by the Myanmar government which recommended equal citizenship rights for Muslims. Since then UN officials have been blanked by the political elite and hostility is being whipped up against reputable, neutral aid agencies.
This story has another shocking dimension. Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel peace laureate, is the elected leader of Myanmar today. She has not only failed to protect the Rohingya minority from injustices, she now damns them all. To her every one of them, woman, child, baby, man, is an 'Islamicist terrorist'. Food can no longer be delivered to the starving.
Tins of UN world food biscuits were found near the places where the recent uprisings took place, so the steely leader accuses aid agencies of treachery and supporting the enemies of her nation.' (This is a favourite Taliban ploy. The lady is all for learning from the worst of humans). Over a dozen Nobel Laureates have publicly condemned Aung San Suu Kyi for colluding with ethnic and religious cleansing.
How did this happen? She was (or seemed to be) a democrat and human rights defender. She spent fifteen years under house arrest when the country was under military rule, was adored by everyone from Popes to Presidents, Princes to pop stars. She wore flowers in her hair. She was honoured by universities, the BBC, Time Magazine. She is Bono's hero, Obama's inspiration, the Dalai Lama's idol. Was mine too.
We were neighbours in Oxford. She lived in Parktown, so did I just a few doors away. We spoke sometimes and once were at a dinner when she criticised the North Vietnamese for their 'cruelties'. She was poised, beautiful, electrifying. Her husband, Dr Michael Aris was a quiet, gentle academic. When he was dying of cancer, she decided to stay in Burma for political reasons. That was when I changed my mind about her. Love was sacrificed for power. Or so it seemed.
Now she has the position she long craved, she turns viciously authoritarian. Freedom of speech is curtailed, so too democratic entitlements.
Westerners still find her irresistible, exotic, an embodiment of eastern stoicism. Besides, like Mandela, she is an an affirmation of their noble commitment to third world development. She makes them feel good.
Besides, the people she is going after are Muslims. Who cares about them? When Islamicist fanatics victimise and terrorise western civilians, there is global outrage. I understand why. What I can't accept is the general indifference that prevails when Muslims are victimised and terrorised by non-Muslim leaders, governments, militias, the military and the hard right.
Since 9/11, we have sunk appallingly low in the league of humans whose lives have value. Moral confusion plays its part too. Most Muslims are killed or maimed by fellow believers in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere. After every terrorist attack, even good, white British friends of mine have less sympathy to spare for blameless Muslims.
So Aung San Suu Kyi is well covered. She will not be stopped. And unlike the similarly threatened Bosnian Muslims in 1994, western allies will not intervene to save Rohingya Muslims. All we can do is weep for them. And call out the fragrant saint who turned into a brutal sinner.

ART BASEL Hong Kong (ABHK), which opens its doors next week, will see the Hong Kong debut of Tay Bak Chiang and his trademark paintings of rocks and boulders. Tay, whose luminous canvases often appear to have been lit from within, says he's thrilled to be involved in such a prestigious fair, the biggest in Asia. Other Singapore artists at ABHK include Jane Lee from STPI and Jimmy Ong from FOST gallery.
iPreciation the gallery is showcasing Tay's canvases at its booth. The works include his latest guqin series, the plucked seven-string Chinese instrument that has become his latest muse. Despite not knowing how to play it, Tay frequently imagines or listens to the music of the guqin while he is working in the studio.
Tay, 43, says: "In the course of studying Chinese culture, I didn't just study its painting traditions but also its musical traditions. The guqin is one of the oldest instruments and I've always seen it as something integral to the Chinese way of life. And though I can't play it, a lot of my friends do so when we meet for tea and sharing sessions."
Tay is the second Singapore artist to debut in ABHK in iPreciation's booth since Lee Wen two years ago. The reception to Tay's show is expected to be good, as Tay's techniques blend Chinese ink painting styles with Western ideas of figuration and abstraction - making his works attractive to the contemporary art lover.
Tay had garnered a fanbase since he began painting full-time more than a decade ago. But his popularity hit a new high when he began painting extraordinarily delicate images of rocks and boulders, which were inspired by a walk in the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.
Tay says: "For me, the purpose of art is to create something unique that no one has seen before. It must be able to move the viewer, evoke new emotions, and give some insight into something. I want the encounter to be sublime, so the viewer can take away something personal and unforgettable from it."
"When I paint rocks these days, it's not rocks that I'm thinking about anymore. I think of them as a manifestation of something else, such as a thought I have or a sentence that captivates me. So when you see these rocks, you sense the traces of some other emotion."
Meanwhile, his new series of guqin paintings is striking for the fact that you rarely see the actual guqin - rather, you see its outline, or some trace of the instrument that had already been removed from the picture.
Tay says: "I'm interested in painting objects that are no longer there. Rocks, boulders and the guqin aren't really objects you find in contemporary homes. I paint all of them from memory, so it is their absence that I am trying to capture."
Art Basel Hong Kong opens next Tue and Wed for VIP previews, and Thu to Sun to the general public, at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre in Wanchai, Hong KongPractice areas

Reporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by Mohammad ZarghamAnother Friendship Jamboree and Logging Show weekend has come and gone. From what I heard throughout the weekend and have read on social media following the weekend’s conclusion, people around the community were very pleased with what they experienced at Jamboree this year.
The Jamboree Committee has been meeting throughout the year, working on plans to expand and improve Jamboree. The committee had several goals this year: increase attendance and participation, increase the number and variety of vendors, and provide live entertainment and over-all make the event more family friendly. It seems like they succeeded on all fronts.
Although sparsely attended at times, the entertainment was, for the most part, top notch. It was almost impossible not to notice the large increase in vendors along Bridge and Adams Streets. Activities for kids were on prominent display from the large climbing wall to the magi show on Friday evening. And I think everyone noticed the increase in the size of the crowd.
All and all it seems like the Jamboree Committee met their goals and provided for a fun and entertaining weekend for our community.
All of this would not have happened without the hard work of the numerous volunteers who help make Jamboree happen each year. But this year involved a lot of extra work and several individuals need to be recognized for their outstanding efforts. Ernie Smith was the Chair once again and pulled together a terrific team. A very special thank you should be directed to four individuals who have been involved throughout the year and were just about everywhere, doing everything, during the weekend. Alicia Normand, Jessie Taylor, Randy Carlton and Lance Kemper did an amazing amount of work on pre-event logistics and planning, advertising the event, pre-weekend set up and post-event clean up. Every time there was a need they volunteered. Without these four this weekend would not have happened. Thank you! - Calories 552

Roast Chicken with Vegetables
Roast a whole chicken and fresh fall veggies for a delicious main dish.
How to Make It
Preheat oven to 475°F. Coat a large roasting pan with cooking spray. Trim chicken of excess fat. Place lemon halves inside cavity. Truss or tie legs with kitchen string; tuck wings underneath body. Set chicken in center of roasting pan and rub all over with butter. Season generously with salt and pepper.
In a large bowl, toss leeks, carrots, parsnips, turnips, potatoes, shallots and thyme with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange vegetables around chicken; pour in broth. Roast for 25 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 400°F. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thigh reads 165°F, 50 to 60 minutes.
Transfer chicken to a large platter, cover loosely with foil and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Before serving, remove any excess fat from roasting pan, then place pan, with vegetables and pan juices, over medium-high heat. (If there are not enough pan juices, pour in 1/4 cup chicken broth.) Cook, tossing vegetables, until warmed through, shiny and glazed, 3 to 5 minutes. Uncover chicken, surround with vegetables and serve warm.Mission First Tactical MFT Vertical RFG React Folding Grip.

Merrill varsity softball hosted a tournament this past Saturday, facing off against Rhinelander, Marquette Senior High and Neillsville. Merrill lost the first game to Rhinelander with a final score of 4-0, generating five hits and committing three errors. The second game against Neillsville turned out much better with a final score of 13-4 with Merrill generating 17 hits and committing just one error. The last game against Marquette saw Merrill on the losing end of a 7-5 final score, generating 13 hits and committing just one error.
Merrill was only able to muster four hits in the opener with Rhinelander-three from Maddix Bonnell and one from Calli Oberg-and they couldn’t produce any runs. Taylor Krueger pitched all seven innings, striking out one, walking none, allowing six hits and four runs-three of them earned.
There was still a strong defensive effort that helped contain Rhinelander and prevented them from scoring. Top fielders include Chelsey LaMonica with nine putouts and an assist, Bonnell with two putouts and three assists, Cassandra Casper with two putouts, both Lindsey Casper and Krueger with a putout and two assists, and both Kelsie Belfiori and Krueger with a putout each.
“Overall, it was a decent day of softball. Our bats slept in a bit through the first game,” comments head coach Matt Ellenbecker. “But I liked how we hit the ball in games 2 and 3. We were overwhelmed against Rhinelander the first time through the order and really squandered a chance to stake an early lead in the first inning. We struck out more in that game than we have in any other this season. Ten Ks is uncharacteristic of us.”
The second game of the day against Neillsville saw a more aggressive offensive effort from the Bluejays that culminated in 13 runs. Merrill scored two runs in every inning except the second and finished off the seventh inning with three runs. Neillsville started a comeback rally in the sixth inning that culminated with two runs in the sixth and seventh innings, but it wasn’t enough to save them.
Offensive leaders for the game include Oberg (2H, 3R, 1RBI), Leonna Ives (4H, 2R, 3RBI, 2 doubles), LaMonica (3H, 1R, 2RBI), Belfiori (3H, 1R, 2RBI, 1BB, triple) and Madisen Weix (1R, 2RBI, 2BB). The game was pitched well by LaMonica; she struck out five, walked one, allowed eight hits and four runs-all earned.
Merrill also fielded very well. Molly Weix lead the effort with six putouts and a double play. Other top fielders include Oberg with five putouts and an assist; Ives with three putouts, an assist and a double play; Bonnell with two putouts, four assists and a double play; Belfiori with two putouts and an assist; and Madisen Weix with two putouts.
The last game of the day was the most hard-fought. Merrill and Marquette both scored two runs in the first inning. Merrill tacked on two more in the third with Marquette ansering with another run in the fourth. Merrill added another run at the top of the fifth but later a series of Marquette line drives and ground balls helped load and promptly empty the bases to add four runs on the scoreboard for Marquette. Merrill would fight until the seventh but would not be able to score any more runs.
Top offensive players for the Marquette game inlcude Ives (2H, 2R), Cassandra Casper (1H, 2RBI, double), Oberg (2H, 1RBI, double), Bonnell (1H, 1R) and LaMonica (1H, 1R). The game was pitched by Krueger who struck out one, walked one, allowed 11 hits and seven runs-six earned.
LaMonica lead the fielding effort with eight putouts and an assist. Other top performaing fielders include Ives with three putouts and three assists; Oberg with three putouts; Madisen Weix with two putouts; and Bonnell with a putout and an assist.
“I was happy with our at-bats in the Marquette game,” he adds. “I found out later on that their pitcher is going to be playing Division 1 college ball next year. She threw with great velocity, but we hit the ball well against her. That was good to see after a frustrating start to the day.”
“We came away from the day learning two big things: we need to improve our efforts in getting bunts down, and we need to clear up our responsibilities and communication on cut offs and relay throws,” Ellenbecker said. “Bunts need to be automatic plays for us offensively, and right now we are struggling to get the ball down. That is so limiting against good teams, and it will come to haunt us come playoff time.”
Win over East
Merrill obliterated Wausau East last Thursday (May 5) with a final score of 25-1, with Merrill making 22 hits and committing no errors.
After a scoreless first inning the lady Jays jumped to an early lead with eight runs in the second inning. They piled on nine more in the third and another eight in the fourth before the game was called. East only managed one run during the bottom of the third.
Runs and RBI abound for the Bluejays with the whole team chipping in to contribute to the huge score. Top batters inlcude Emily Travis (3H, 4R, 3RBI, double), Kelsie Belfiori (4H, 3R, 1RBI, 1BB), Madisen Weix (1H, 3R, 2RBI), Lindsey Casper (2H, 3R, 2RBI), Chelsey LaMonica (2H, 2R, 3RBI, double), Stephanie Schroder (1H, 2R, 2RBI), Maddix Bonnell (1H, 2R, double) and Payton Waldburger (1H, 2R, 1RBI, 1BB).
Taylor Kreuger pitched four innings, striking out two, walking none, allowing four hits and one earned run. Belfiori pitched one inning and struck out one, walked none and allowed two hits and no runs.
The defensive effort was lead by Molly Weix, Calli Oberg and Leonna Ives all with three putouts and an assist. Other include Lamonica with two putouts and an assist, Waldburger with a putout and Madisen Weix with three assists.
The game against Wausau West originally scheduled for today (May 10th) has been moved to Wednesday, May 11th due to weather.

I want to thank Pender Veterinary Centre from the bottom of my heart. The care my Lab Sonny received during his 4 day stay in the hospital was extraordinary! The ENTIRE staff was amazing, especially Dr. Voell. He was a pretty sick boy but Dr. Voell never gave up faith. I will be forever grateful for all he did.
I was a wreck but Pender allowed me to stay and visit and that made me happy! Dr. Voell also called me every day to give me an update. He communicated the medical terminology in such a way that it was very easy to understand. There was so much compassion and desire to see that my dog received the best care possible. Pender genuinely cares about their patients!
Prior to the recent hospital stay, Sonny was receiving cold laser therapy for his arthritis. Pender has state of the art laser equipment and Sonny's mobility improved tremendously!
The front desk staff is super friendly as well. All of the technicians have been beyond wonderful. Other Drs are very professional and on top of their game. Sonny has made a few special friends at Pender and we love them all!
I would recommend Pender to anyone in need of a vet. They sure have made a difference in my (and my pet's) life!
- I would recommend this business
- They do what's right, not what's good business. Extremely caring and compassionate!!!
- I haven't found any.
We have always had dogs, and Pender's is BY FAR the best veterinarian practice we've ever found. They are the most caring and compassionate group of technicians and doctors!!!
When my dog had a tumor, one vet suggested we put him down, another said he'd have to go under anesthesia, and most likely wouldn't make it. He's 15+ with cancer. Pender veterinarian examined him, and removed the tumor in 10 minutes with a local, and it cost under $250.00, more than $1500 less than the other vet.
I could write a book on the great care and service they have provided to our beloved pets, but I'll summarize by saying, I wouldn't take my pets to another vet again. I'll drive hours instead if I had to. They're that good.
PS: They're the only vet in the area that treats animals, including exotics, that are found injured. They have a practice run by donations to save animals in need. They truly care about animals, not just a business for them.nicolemalstrom Play via YouTube OPEN IN APP NSFW Safe Is this playlist safe for work? Blank.

But there are so many other people still waiting and its driving me insane. I don't know how much longer we can carry this on for. I really don't. I just feel so emotionally drained and exhausted. I don't know what each day will bring, I panic if the phone rings, or if I get stuck in traffic. I am constantly on the go, on high speed mode and no stop control. I barely sleep, even when shattered the sleep I get is restless, its like I cant shut down properly, because if I do then I may miss that call.
Watching the transplant programs made me realize how much I need to be at harefield when the call does come in. I need to be there to see him into theatre, to hold his hand as he goes in, to kiss him goodbye. I need to do that. People say my #1 prioity must be the kids, and they are up there at #1, but so is peter. They all need me equally but for different reasons. I don't know if I could sit at harefield for the full op, but I need to be there for that moment.

hey Sarah,
Emily here, from the Live Life Then Give Life campaign. Thank you so much for your support, and for giving me your blog address, I have my fingers tightly crossed that the call comes for Peter really soon, we are all doing everything you can to spread the word and raise awareness. Keep on fighting and staying positive. love and warmest wishes, Emily(Still working on actual posts, but here, have a snippet…)
“One perpetual confusion among external Empire-watchers is the confusion between the Ministries of Throne and State and the Shadow Ministries – for example, between the Ministry of Harmonious Serenity, which is a duly empowered governance instrumentality and enforcer of rights and obligations both fundamental and civil, and the Ministry of Exquisition, which is a private Empire-wide circle of branches self-tasked with the promotion of fabulosity, and whose closest approach to governmental power is its chief executive’s entreé to the Court of Courts.
“It is this latter that gives rise to this designation: the leading figure of a Shadow Ministry is afforded the title of Minister as a praetorian courtesy rank along with their entreé; from this, the designation of such courtier-led associations individually as Ministries and collectively as the Shadow Ministries is a simple matter of back-formation and custom.
“Since everyone moving in such circles as are likely to bring them into contact with the Shadow Ministries or the Court of Courts are comfortably aware of this distinction, it is unlikely that any clarifying changes will be made; one should consult the latest edition of the Registry of the Imperial Service (available for reference at any Imperial Services office or directly from the Ministry of Civic Information1) to determine which type of Ministry you are dealing with.”
– Ten Thousand Parts in Approximate Formation: The Empire from Outside
1. A Ministry of State, underneath the Ministry of the Empire, a Ministry of the Throne.Abstract.
Introduction
Human confrontations1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25 from one-on-one fights3,4,5 through to collective protests6,7,8,9,10, mass violence11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 and even online acts of aggression24,25, are of great societal importance. However our understanding of the dynamics at the event-by-event level remains limited (e.g. a child's repeated cry-attacks against a parent3,4,5) where each side (‘Red’ and ‘Blue’) is engaged in a complex cat-and-mouse game of adaptation and counter-adaptation, and where agility and secrecy (e.g. of Red) can enhance the ability to launch attacks8,9,20,21,22,23 (e.g. against Blue). While ‘big data’ approaches to non-confrontational human activities have revealed new patterns26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33, the presence of aggression and danger means that event records for a particular confrontation run the risk of being incomplete or biased15. These considerations motivate us to analyze a broad spectrum of heterogeneous event-level datasets drawn from independent sources across multiple disciplines, not limited to armed conflict16,17,18,19, crossing from local to global geographic scales and in both real and online worlds. Our data sources are listed in the Supplementary Information (SI). We find that in all these systems, the distribution of the severity of events and the trend in the timing of events, are each described by a power-law function of the form “AB−C”.
Results
Each point in Fig. 1 results from the maximum likelihood fitting of the power-law Ms−α to the tail in the distribution of the severity of individual events within a given confrontation, where s is the severity of an individual event which, in the case of violent conflict, is the number killed or injured in an attack. α is the power-law exponent, M is the normalizing factor, and p is the goodness-of-fit16,17,18. Figure 1A inset illustrates this power-law tail distribution, while full details of the statistical fitting procedure are described in the cited references of the Methods section. We can analyze event severities and timings separately since they show no systematic cross-correlation, as illustrated in the SI. Specifically, while the event severity distribution is stationary throughout the confrontation to a good approximation, the timing of individual events is a non-stationary process with periods of initial escalation or de-escalation.
Each data-point shows (p, α) values for event severity distribution Ms−α (Fig. 1A inset) for confrontations. (A) within a given continent (Africa); (B) across the globe, for different actors and different injury levels; (C) within a given country (departments in Colombia). (D) shows conventional wars and sexual violence against women5. Suicides etc. form a near continuum at p = 0 with α ≫ 2.5. The darker the color of each data-point, the larger the total number of victims (see SI). Red star shows value for global terrorism17, green ring is value for entire Africa database, purple ring is value for all interstate wars from 1860–1980. Dashed horizontal line shows theoretical benchmark α = 2.5 derived from the simple version of our theory, as described in the text; SI shows α = 2.5 result is robust to generalizations. Red shaded area corresponds to goodness-of-fit p < 0.05. Inset in Fig. 1D shows empirically determined Red operational network for PIRA in South Armagh20. Fig. 1D lists other empirically determined α values. Domains are omitted in Figs. 1,2,3 if we lacked the necessary data (see SI).
Our results for the timing of individual events are summarized by Figs. 2 and 3, where each point results from the maximum-likelihood fit of a power-law τ1n−β to the trend in successive inter-event time intervals τn between the n'th and the (n + 1)'th event within a given confrontation, with n = 1, 2, 3 etc. and with τ1 being the intercept on a log-log plot of τn vs. n19. This procedure is illustrated in Fig. 3 upper inset. The residuals in each least-square fit are approximately Gaussian-distributed and i.i.d., as required for the maximum likelihood best-fit (see SI). The event timing results in Figs. 2 and 3 mostly show escalation (β > 0) with some de-escalation (β < 0). We do not address how, why or when each confrontation ends (or begins) but instead focus on the non-stationary behavior leading up to this endgame.
(A) Each point denotes a unique infant-parent pair, obtained using analysis in Fig. 3 upper inset. Underlying events are cry-face attacks by infant (Red) against parent (Blue). The experiment is described in Ref. 4. (B) Each point denotes a unique geographic location. Underlying events are street protests by anti-government groups (Red) against Polish government (Blue). (C) Each point denotes a unique sector of national cyber-infrastructure. Underlying events are cyber-attacks by foreign group (Red) against indicated sector's defenses (Blue). (D) Each point denotes a particular U.S. financial institution stock. Underlying events are attacks by ultrafast predatory traders (Red) against the remaining market of slower global investors (Blue). We can reject the null hypothesis that these linear fits emerge by chance, by randomizing event times and then comparing probability distribution of R2 fits to the real value
in order to generate p significance values (Fig. 2A,
, p = 0.0089; Fig. 2B,
, p = 5.6 × 10−5; Fig. 2C,
, p = 0.036; Fig. 2D,
, p = 0.0087). See SI for more details.
For a given symbol, each data-point shows the (τ1, β) values obtained from fitting trend in inter-event times (upper inset) within a confrontation in a unique region or city within a given country, mostly in Africa but also including Middle East and South America. SI contains key to symbols. Several best-fit lines are shown as a guide. Separate symbols for attacks against government forces, and against civilians. Red star shows result for global terrorism. Upper inset shows escalation of Red attacks in Belfast. Lower inset shows Belfast (solid red square) is abnormal compared to Armagh and Down (red squares with yellow centers).
For the analysis of event severities in Figs. 1A–1C, the α exponent values for the power-law severity distribution are broadly bunched around 2.5 with statistically significant goodness-of-fit, i.e. p > 0.05. (See the cited references in Methods for details on how to determine and interpret these p values). For the analysis of the trend in the timing of events (Figs. 2–3) the β parameter governing the trend from the outset of the confrontation, shows an approximate linear dependence on logτ1, implying that within each domain the confrontations in which initial events are frequent tend to slow down over time (β negative when τ1 is small) whereas they accelerate if events started slowly (β large positive when τ1 is large). In Fig. 2A for infant attacks, this is particularly remarkable since each point corresponds to a different infant (and parent), and the experiment underlying each point is performed at separate times. A random process in which individuals become victims independently with a constant probability, would have yielded p = 0 with an arbitrary α value in Fig. 1, thereby explaining the values in Fig. 1D for suicides, homicides, and death by accident and disease, while for timings the β values would have been evenly scattered around β = 0 with no strong linear dependence. (See SI for empirical confirmation of these statements). Our results benefit from out-of-sample testing: Ref. 34 provides a public, time-stamped record of our 2005 pilot study of two wars that hinted at a severity distribution Ms−α with α ≈ 2.5, while Ref. 16 adds seven more and terrorism. Likewise Ref. 19 records our 2011 pilot study of two wars suggesting τ1n−β for event timings with β linearly dependent on log τ1. Here we move beyond wars and terrorism with Figs. 1,2,3 providing blind test results for every dataset made available to us in the interim years.
Discussion
The confrontations that follow the benchmark behavior generally feature an actor (Red, e.g. cyber-hackers, insurgents, terrorists, protestors, ultrafast traders, infant) who is in principle weaker than its Blue opposition (respectively, the national infrastructure, incumbent army, security forces, ruling government, global stock holders, parent), yet who manages to inflict a series of attacks that typically escalates (β > 0 in Figs. 2–3). We develop our explanatory model by referring to the most recent and detailed fieldwork available of such a Red group20: PIRA (the Provisional IRA) who inflicted an escalating number of attacks against the stronger British government forces (Blue) in Northern Ireland from 1969 onwards20. PIRA's operational network shown in Fig. 1D inset, has a decentralized structure consistent with jihadist operational networks9,21,23 and with other clandestine and illicit groups, e.g. online gold farmers35. Its resources – which in Fig. 1D inset are people but for more general Red may include technology, predatory algorithms (Figs. 2C–D) or even abstract cognitive processes for the case of infant (Fig. 2A)3,4 – are partitioned into clusters (‘cells’ or ‘units’) where a cluster's components do not have to be spatially close, just coordinated in some way (e.g. by phone). In short, network connections indicate empirical evidence of some coordinated activity, not spatial proximity.
Clusters can begin to coordinate together over time (i.e. clusters coalesce)9,20,21,22,29 but can also lose internal coordination (cluster fragments) under conditions of external or internal stress9,20,21,22,29, just as a cluster of animals disperses if in danger or a start-up company dissolves if it loses common purpose36. Adding the empirical finding that larger social clusters show more churn than smaller ones29, yields the simplest form of our dynamical cluster theory whose exact solution (see SI) is a Red cluster-size distribution of the form Ms−α with α = 2.5, consistent with Fig. 1D inset, with gang sizes in Asia and Chicago (α = 2.3)12 and with cyber-crowds of traders through the proxy of trade size (α = 2.5)31. Following recent empirical findings linking size to lethality14,18, we take a cluster's size as proportional to the severity of an event in which it participates, hence reproducing the severity distribution Ms−α with α = 2.5. We explored many generalizations of this theory but find that Ms−α with α ≈ 2.5 is remarkably robust (see SI). Changing the rigidity of larger Red clusters successively from more rigid to less rigid, moves the α values from below 2 to above 3, hence providing an interpretation for individual confrontations in Figs. 1A–C. Restricting connectivity between Red clusters to physical contact on a two-dimensional grid like an urban street setting or battlefield, pushes α toward 1.9 with a weaker power-law (p → 0) hence explaining most of the conventional wars in Fig. 1D and the α = 2.0 value for Chicago strikes10.
The notion that Red's self-organized, decentralized cluster structure (Fig. 1D inset) helps it adapt faster and/or better than Blue, is consistent with recent findings that organic structures are more conducive to innovation than bureaucratic ones36. Indeed, ultrafast traders (Red, Fig. 2D) carry out their attacks in under a second. We introduce x(n) to represent Red's relative advantage over Blue following the last (n'th) attack, where x(n) follows a general stochastic process. For simplicity, we set the instantaneous rate of Red attacks as proportional to x(n) when x(n) > 0 (i.e. when Red has a relative advantage) and zero when x(n) < 0 (i.e. when Blue has a relative advantage) though this can be generalized. The rate of Red attacks in a confrontation that is generally escalating, then scales as x(n)|rms ∝ nβ′ (see SI) where β′ characterizes the correlations in x(n) (β′ = 0.5 for an uncorrelated process). The time between attacks, which is approximately the inverse rate, is therefore proportional to n−β′ enabling us to identify β′ = β. This explains why τ1n−β describes the attack timings and implies that if β > 0.5, Red's lead over Blue follows a positively correlated process, while it follows a negatively correlated one if 0 < β < 0.5. Confrontations that de-escalate (i.e. β < 0) can be treated similarly. Our theory then reproduces the linear dependence between β and log τ1 if we introduce coupling between the underlying x(n) processes. Such coupling could arise if the same Red entity underlies attacks in different places, e.g. in Fig. 2B the same social movement underlies protests in different locations.
Figures 1,2,3 reveal surprising dynamical equivalences between confrontations and hence offer novel data proxies and cross-domain insights: The escalation of events in Magdalena, Colombia (black oval ring) is representative of all confrontations in Fig. 3; the relative position of General Electric (GE) in Fig. 2D makes predatory trade attacks on it akin to cyber-attacks on the Hi-tech Electronics sector (Fig. 2C) which in turn mimic specific infant-parent dyads (Fig. 2A) and protest locations (Fig. 2B); and the conflict in Sierra Leone, Africa, has the same (p, α) in Fig. 1 as the narco-guerilla war in Antioquia, Colombia. Deviations from the benchmark behavior act as a novel alert mechanism for abnormalities in Red and/or Blue behavior, e.g. Angola in Fig. 1A, which serves to warn researchers against using such a confrontation as representative. The time-interval abnormality in Fig. 3 (upper inset) turns out to straddle the ‘Bloody Sunday’ attack by Blue on civilians on 30 January 1972, implying that neighboring points offer insight into the build-up to, and consequences of, an extreme Blue intervention. Interestingly Bloody Sunday appears as the culmination of escalating PIRA attacks, not their trigger, hence raising new questions about its strategic importance. The fact that Belfast's (τ1, β) values in Fig. 3 (lower inset) destroy any linear dependence, is consistent with the recent fieldwork finding20 that Belfast's PIRA network is quite distinct to Fig. 1D inset. The fact that sexual attacks against women do not appear as an outlier in Fig. 1, hints at some hidden clustering (like Fig. 1D inset) of attackers or attacks.
We have shown that both the severities and the timings of events in a wide range of systems, follow a power-law functional form. There are various practical prediction tools and policies that follow from our work, as we now discuss. Suppose some sporadic attacks have been observed in a given location or sector in the real or online world. If the trend in successive time-intervals between attacks is found to follow τ1n−β, this suggests a single Red-Blue process (x(n)) underlies them. Assuming Red dominates the Red-Blue dynamic x(n) (i.e. Blue has not yet counter-adapted), this points to a single attacking Red individual or group. If attacks then emerge in different locations or sectors, detecting an approximate linear relationship in β vs. log τ1 points to this same Red operating in these different places. Figure 2C hence supports media speculation that current cyber-attacks against different sectors of US infrastructure come from a single Red entity24. Likewise, Fig. 2D suggests that a common set of predatory algorithms and/or trading firms (Red) may underlie recent ‘flash’ instabilities in different stocks25. For Fig. 2A, the independence of the participants suggests that this linear pattern is revealing a new innate feature of how infants and parents interact.
Now imagine the scenario in which two attacks occur in a new location that was previously quiet, and that this same Red is suspected. An estimate for β in this new location can be read off from the existing β vs. log τ1 plot by inputting this single inter-event time as an estimate for τ1. Future attack times can then be estimated using τ1n−β (see SI for examples).
Next consider the severities of events as they begin to emerge in a given sector. Suppose a crude Ms−α distribution is found with α ≈ 2.5 and p > 0.05. This points to Red having a similar delocalized cluster structure to our model. Indeed, even without any observed events and hence without any event severities from which to estimate the distribution, the weight of evidence in Fig. 1 suggests that any future confrontation involving a similarly structured Red will produce a severity distribution Ms−α with α ≈ 2.5 and p > 0.05. The expected number of victims in a future attack is therefore approximately [(α − 1)/(α − 2)]smin where smin is the cut-off in the maximum-likelihood fit37. Taking α ≈ 2.5 as in Fig. 1 and smin ≈ 1, this expected number is 3, which happens to coincide with the recent Boston marathon attack. The probability the next attack will be twice as lethal, is (s/smin)1−α ≈ (s/smin)−1.5 with s = 6, giving 0.07 (i.e. 7%). The severity of the most fatal attack will grow as the number of attacks n grows, following n1/(α−1) ≈ n0.67. Dividing attacks equally into less violent and more violent, the fraction of victims falling in the most violent half is given by 2−(α−2)/(α−1) = 0.8 meaning that a few attacks will produce the majority of the victims. Another relevant consequence of our clustering theory is that the ongoing coalescence-fragmentation process means that a ‘lone wolf’ actor is only truly alone for short periods of time, which is again consistent with recent field studies22, and provides an estimate for how long ago contact was made with other Red clusters.
The stability of α in Fig. 1 throughout a given confrontation (see SI) suggests that the corresponding Red group self-organizes rapidly after its inception, as confirmed by our model's dynamics, and hence latent Red groups that have not yet launched any attacks may already have a structure resembling Fig. 1D inset. More generally, although the overall command structure of a present or future Red might be hierarchical, or publicly portrayed as so, our theory aligns with recent empirical findings9,20,21,23 in predicting that operationally Red will self-organize into a far flatter, clustered structure similar to Fig. 1D inset. As a corollary, our clustering theory also identifies a novel ‘Achilles Heel’ for such a Red: The self-organized nature of the clustering means that Blue can avoid having to find and destroy the largest (i.e. most lethal) Red clusters, by instead regularly breaking up smaller (i.e. less powerful) ones. The mathematics specifies conditions required to keep formation of large (lethal) clusters below a desired rate, and so reduce the threat level of large future attacks. It also warns that if Blue is insufficiently active in counter-measures, and hence the overall rate at which it fragments Red clusters becomes too small (
where N is an estimate of Red's size38) then Red will grow exponentially fast into one super-cluster of maximum possible lethality. Finally, our clustering theory predicts a necessary condition39 νfragp/νcoalq > 1 that must be met before a covert message or doctrine can spread within Red, where νcoal is the cluster coalescence rate, p is the transmission rate of the message between two people in a Red cluster, and q is the rate at which this message gets forgotten or corrupted.
Methods
The power-law analysis that we use to obtain our results in Fig. 1 for the tail in the distribution of the severity of individual events, follows exactly the state-of-the-art testing procedure described in Refs. 16,17,18 and firmly established in Ref. 40. Our analysis of the trend in the timings of individual events follows exactly the method presented in Ref. 19. Our proposed model of cluster coalescence-fragmentation for Red, which reproduces the 2.5 power-law result for the severity distribution, comprises a population of objects (agents) that self-organize into clusters according to the stated rules of cluster coalescence and fragmentation. The mathematical derivation of the 2.5 result is given in the SI. We have also investigated many variants of this coalescence-fragmentation cluster model and found (see SI) that most retain a power-law with exponent near 2.5. For the trend in the timings of attacks, a null model comparison showing the statistical significance of our benchmark result is given in the SI, together with the derivation of our stochastic model for Red's relative advantage over Blue which reproduces this timings benchmark.

Land and water areas
The following attributes are included:
Area values (in hectares) for terrestrial ecozones, ecoprovinces, ecoregions and ecodistricts of Canada have been calculated using a Lambert Equal Area projection hydrologic map coverage created by the Canadian Soil Information System (CanSIS), Research Branch, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. This hydrographic coverage represents land, freshwater, and marine water within Canada. This coverage was merged with the ecozone, ecoprovince, ecoregion and ecodistrict map polygons to provide land and freshwater area values for each. The standard of what does constitute the official land and freshwater area of Canada is described in Sebert and Munro (1972). Land and freshwater bounded by coastline are included. Bodies of freshwater shared by Canada and the USA, such as the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River are included to the international boundary. The mouth of the St. Lawrence River to the western tip of Anticosti Island is considered freshwater, as well as Bras d’Or Lake on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. Lake Melville in Labrador is considered marine water.
The hydrographic coverage, which was derived from 1:1,000,000 scale source data (National Topographic Series), includes only relatively large water bodies. Most lakes included in this hydrographic coverage are greater than 1 square kilometer in size. There are a significant number of smaller lakes not included in the calculation of land and freshwater in this database. This results in a slight over-estimate of land area, and a serious under-estimate of the water area. In comparison with previously calculated national total for land and freshwater (9,970,610 km2) in the Canada Yearbook (Statistics Canada 1994), the CanSIS estimates of land area (9,948,445 km2) account for 101.4% of all land area in Canada, and 80.4% of all freshwater area in Canada. Pro-rating of these areas will not account for local variation in the density and distribution of small water bodies, and is not an accurate reflection of their natural distribution.
This subject is treated more thoroughly in the CanSIS documentation for the SLC version 2.2 LAT table. AREA_TOTAL, AREA_LAND and AREA_WATER fields were derived from the AREA_TOTAL, AREA_LAND and HYDRO_FRESH fields in the SLC v2.2 LAT table. There are some errors due to rounding, so the totals for the country are not consistent between the estimates in the SLC LAT and the Ecological Framework tables.

”Project Runway” recap: Real-woman attack!
Nine hundred sixty-nine. Is it the number of times Christian said that word? The amount of sequins and pearls on Steven’s wedding dress? The gallons of tears shed by Ricky? Nope. It’s the total pounds last night’s models have lost. So without further ado, let’s give those 11 women a round of applause for their accomplishment. And while we’re at it, let’s thank them for inspiring a challenge that finally met the high creative standards we’ve grown to expect on Project Runway. I was beginning to think all we’d be getting this season was more of the same old go shopping at Mood, then make an outfit! tasks, which were fast becoming bo-oo-ring. But refashioning the newly slimmed-down ladies’ former favorite outfits? All right! The final looks may not have rocked my world, but at least they were the product of inventiveness. Plus, they were geared toward what the show so enjoys calling ”the everyday woman.”
Or, in the fashion world: those insane people who still eat carbs. When the first model’s silhouette appeared in the runway’s illuminated logo screen, the designers looked alternately amused, surprised, and confused. ”It looked like a crazy fairy princess or transvestites or something,” said Sweet P. ‘Cause, you know, if a silhouette isn’t a size zero, it’s just gotta be enchanted royalty or a bunch of cross-dressers. Steven proved that he’s watched PR before — or at the very least, last season — when he wondered if the women appearing before them could be the groups’ sisters or mothers. Decent theory — if he’d actually recognized any of them as his own relative! The prize for best euphemistic use of the English language goes to Jillian, who described the women’s outfits as ”really tremendous clothing.” Well sure, if by ”tremendous” you mean ”god-awful leftovers from the fall 1987 Sears catalogue.”
For the third time in a row, Sweet P was the last to get picked/paired with a model. But it didn’t seem to matter, since she managed to bang out a decent-looking (albeit pea green) dress. (Could have done without the black hose, though.) And besides, Heidi had already assigned Steven the most tremendousoutfit to retool: a big, white, polyester-satin wedding gown covered in lots and lots o’ embellishments and lace. As soon as he explained to Tim Gunn that he was going to spend his $10 budget on black stretch material for a dress, it was pretty clear he was in trouble. Yes, it was gaudy polyester and all, but couldn’t he have made a pretty, fun, white frock? I’m thinking something along the lines of what Molly Ringwald did in Pretty in Pink, when she recycled Annie Potts’ old pink prom dress. Oh, and dude, glue? Glue? Did nutty Vincent’s attempt at pasting together a so-called couture gown last season teach you nothing?
Maybe Heidi simply assigned the wedding dress to the wrong person. Because there was someone in the workroom last night who was dying to get his hands on that ball of synthetic meringue: Chris March. Chris is back! His return was cause for celebration in the workroom (and in my apartment). Of course, it came at the bittersweet price of losing Jack. He had the terrible luck of getting a MRSA infection (a very serious type of staph), and as it worsened, he had to wrestle with the decision to leave the competition. It was heartbreaking to see him so upset. But taking care of himself obviously far outweighs trying to tough it out on a reality show. We wish you well, Jack.
Chris wasn’t the only person whose return filled me with glee. There was also Tim Gunn. Now, I know he hasn’t been totally absent the past four episodes, but his screen time has been pretty minimal. Last night, however, he finally got his due, causing the whole team to giggle over his inadvertent innuendo about making bad mistakes at 3 a.m. ”I really am an old fart,” he said. ”My brain didn’t even go there.” Which is precisely why we love you so, Mr. Gunn.
Anyway, back to work. As Steven fretted over the lousy card he drew this time around, Kevin (a.k.a the Beard, a.k.a. Mr. Fatone, a.k.a. I’m Straight, Goddamn It!) was ”like, game on!” because he ”loves making clothes for real people.” (Guy’s got a point; designing for imaginary friends is such a bummer.) Across the room, Ricky’s model expressed her approval of his design, which of course sent him back to his old weepy ways. (For once, the guy didn’t choke last night. Perhaps it was thanks to all that preening he did in front of the mirror in the altered jeans and gold lamé pumps? ) Meanwhile, Christian’s model explained she wore no prints, colors, dresses, skirts, or anything that would show her arms. But if you thought Christian was going to let a silly thing like a fussy customer bring him down, you don’t know Christian. ”I’m really confident,” he announced with characteristic modesty.
And guess what? He had every right to be confident. His jeans, T-shirt, and pin-tucked jacket were the best designs of the night. The look was modern, flattered his model, and deserved to win. Kevin’s strapless thingy was probably Christian’s toughest competition, and the Bearded One got it right when he said he’d turned his model into a Charlie’s Angel. Alas, Michael Kors is so over black leggings. (Join the club, Kors. Next week, will you please call a moratorium on skinny jeans as well?)

The Malletech Orchestra Series OR39B Hard Birch Xylo/Bell Mallets are a lightweight mallet that is best used for passages below forte. In spite of its slightly softer material, lower density and lower model number, the ORJ9 produces a brighter tone at low volume than model OR42. At mezzo forte, model ORJ9 will sound almost identical to model OR42. The advantage of this stick lies in its bright, light tone at lower dynamic levels, and its easy maneuverability.
The four models in the Orchestra Series are constructed of the materials and weights selected by professional players as having the most practical application to the major orchestral parts of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Hello, oldie DTC-er here hoping for some IVF advice as I know a number of you lovely ladies have been through it. I am doing the long (microdose flare) protocol so just about to start on the pill. Specialist has suggested we throw everything at it so we are also doing the Colorado protocol alongside it (which means taking pencillin, oestradiol, aspirin, steroids and wearing testosterone patches all together at some point in the process). Has anyone else done this? The number of drugs on top of the injections seems a bit overwhelming!
Did you have any side effects?
Did you take any time off work at all? Specialist suggested taking 3-5 days off around time of egg collection.
Anything else that is helpful to know?
Also if anyone has any success stories doing IVF with a pretty much non existent AMH level I would love to hear them!
Thanks!!
09/09/2013 at 10:08
Hello D, sorry I haven't done your protocols but did one round of ivf icsi last summer which led to our little boy.
It is a bit overwhelming anyway I think - getting the amounts of medicine right, timing the injections etc. so totally normal to feel how you do, especially as you are doing extra. Are you planning to do acupuncture alongside it?
My Consultant said I only needed to take the EC day off but personally I don't think that's enough. I was a bit sore after the op and was on tenterhooks emotionally so wouldn't have been ready to go in to work. As it happened we had bad news the next day wrt our fertilisation rate (only one of 11 eggs fertilised) so we had a 2 day transfer not 5, so I would have needed to be off work 2 days later anyway. Sounds like your Dr has it about right with time off, but if you can I would leave the option of having more. I think I had 9 days in total as I felt I needed to do everything possible to help our little runt of an emby as it wasn't the best grade and I was a bit knackered from it all. I did go out of my mind a bit though and was desperate to get back to work in the end to take my mind off the 2ww! I did scans etc. before work so didn't need any other time off.
Though I haven't done your protocol, if it helps, I had a really positive experience physically. Barely any side effects, the odd rough and tired day when DR but on the whole we were both pleasantly surprised by how it went and how I felt. It also passed really quickly, bar the few days before testing, which obviously crawled by! If I can help or you want to talk anytime, just give me a shout.
When do you start? Wishing you loads of luck.
09/09/2013 at 11:26
I have no idea about ivf protocols, but just wanted to say hi, and hope it's successful for you
09/09/2013 at 12:00
Thanks BW.
Lamby thanks for sharing your experience. I will be freeing up my diary then around egg collection time, shouldn't be too hard to get time off. Glad to hear it was physically ok for you. I am nervous about the emotional side as I have been on clomiphene most of this year and at times have felt really low on it. I am starting the pill tomo and will get a more detailed plan in the next few days. It's good to hear you had a positive outcome in the end despite bad news. I will definitely shout out with any more questions that arise.
09/09/2013 at 12:18
The micro flare/dose protocol is very American in my experience! Those meds have different names over here (lupron is prostrap for example) and the protocols aren't typical for first time use here.
I've heard of all components of the Colorado protocol (although not that term!) being used for second or third cycles when the first has been unsuccessful. Again, the British seem to be quite conservative and only like to add extras when necessary rather than attack from all side from the very start.
My EC was under general and on a Friday. If I hadn't had complications, I think I may have been fine with one day off, but would have preferred more. However I developed OHSS which got gradually worse after EC, but I was unlucky (although did get a hen house full of eggs!) so I got a lot worse before I got better.
I also second Lamby in that until I did my trigger injection 36 hours before EC, I felt surprisingly normal. I expected to feel different but I didn't. It was only after the trigger, and the onset of OHSS that I began to feel horrendous. Hopefully that won't happen to you though x
09/09/2013 at 12:55
Hi Ducky - yes the reason we are going all out first off is because I am 40 in a couple of months, my AMH is very low, we are paying for treatment and apparently they often suggest the Colorado protocol as they have had a lot of clients come back asking did they try absolutely everything. Although there is no hard and fast evidence for the protocol, it certainly does no harm. I hope you are feeling better now, awful to develop OHSS! I don't think there is is any chance that I will have this issue. Do you know when your FET will be?
09/09/2013 at 13:03
The risk factors for ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS) are under 35, high AMH and PCOS. I tick all three!
I imagine as your AMH is low, they will be in much better control of your response to the drugs and you'll be able to tolerate much higher doses. I was on a really small dose and kept recruiting more tiny follicles rather than the big ones growing to maturity. They almost had to cancel due to poor response which I though was quite ironic given I ended up oversrimulating when they increased my dose by a smidgen.
It is all very clever and an emotional rollercoaster to say the least. I was somewhat relieved when I was told they were freezing all embryos and not going to embryo transfer (I found this out the morning of EC). At first I was disappointed but not I'm not sure I'd have the energy to be in the 2ww, I am in awe of ladies who go through I whole cycle, I cheated and got a breather!
I think FET will probably be November time. I'll find out more at our follow up appointment this Friday. Good luck with everything, really hope it is all straightforward for you x
09/09/2013 at 18:47
No personal experience of all the drugs, and the ones I was taken not a clue what they were all called.
For EC I was similar to Ducky as I had GA on the Thursday rested over the weekend (our weekend is Friday/ Saturday) and was fine to go back to the office on Sunday. As yet my 1 embryo is frozen and for various reason due to may body failing we have not had a chance to put it back it.
I didn't really find EC as bad as expected. Hope it all goes well for you!!
09/09/2013 at 21:16
No experience but Diamonds, lovely to see you back and I really hope you have a straightforward and successful round of IVF.
I really hope you can't drink on your 40th as you are upduffed xxx
09/09/2013 at 21:46
Hi, I remember you from the DTTC threads
No experience of your protocol - we did the short protocol last summer as I had 90+ day cycles. I didn't have any noticeable side effects from taking the drugs other than localised irritation from the injections (although we didn't do the down-regging so don't know if that made a difference)
I didn't take time off work, but I did work from home between egg collection and testing. I actually found the egg retrieval ok. I was a bit freaked out about being sedated so I just did it with painkillers instead, and we went home about an hour after the procedure.
Like Lamby I also had acupuncture, and I found it really helped. I also used the Zita West IVF CD which was really good for visualisation.
We had 12 eggs retrieved, 6 fertilised, and only 3 were any good. Even then they weren't great quality, but we had the best one put in and our 6 month old is now asleep in the bedroom!
10/09/2013 at 10:26
Thank you VE, let's hope so!
LC I don't think there is the option for GA here, just sedation. Hope you don't have to wait too much longer for your transfer and keeping everything crossed for you.
SC hello again, nice to her it all worked out for you. I'm not sure about the acupuncture ..... How many sessions did you have and at what stage? I might check out that CD.
Ducky good luck for Fri, keep us posted on the DTC thread. It seems very quiet on there since the separation of the boards .... Shame as it was good to chat to all you lot regularly.
10/09/2013 at 22:20
Hi, sorry for the delay getting back to you! We started the acupuncture at the same time as starting the IVF. I know that it is recommended to start before treatment, but we weren't able to, so it worked for us just doing it from the start of treatment. I had sessions pretty frequently to start with and then carried on having them every 4 weeks while I was pregnant. Not sure if it had any effect medically, but it definitely helped me feel better about it all, so it was worth it for that alone.
11/09/2013 at 07:43
Hi diamonds! I was on the MTTC boards with you before...had a name change. We didn't do that protocol but I found the whole experience not as bad physically as I feared and I just took it easy. I actually took EC off and left it open about my return, I was in really bad pain after for a good week or so but it sounds like that isn't normal. The 2ww is tough and we only had 2 embryos fertilise and of those only 1 was suitable for transfer. My little miracle has just woken up so even bad news during the process doesn't mean a bad outcome :-) Wishing you all the luck in the world x
12/09/2013 at 07:36
No idea honey but SO pleased to hear you are receiving private treatment. You so deserve this to work. Good luck x x
12/09/2013 at 08:39
I have no experience/advice, but just want to say hi and wish you all the luck in the world. Will have my fingers firmly crossed for some good news from you soon x
14/09/2013 at 10:17
Sorry I am late getting back to this.
SC, thanks for that info. The thought of it puts me off but I have heard people say how relaxing it is, so I will have a look into it.
Smarties ..... what was your username before? It's good to hear a number of people have had success despite not so good news during the process.
Hello Hollywood and BG, thanks for the good wishes x
14/09/2013 at 16:26
Good luck with your treatment! It sounds like they're really trying to optimise your chance of success which is great. I'm an embryologist so don't know a great deal about the drug regime aspect of ivf but I can do my best to answer any questions you might have once you've had your egg collection. X

© 2016 goitm.orgNow that I am on winter break from school and have lots of free time on my hands, I have decided to post some book reviews that I wrote back before I started this site. I want to do this for two reasons. First of all, I love some of these books and would love to share them with you guys. Secondly, I know myself and my tendency to get obsessive during the semester and so, anticipating that there will probably be a posting drought in our future, I want to get some stuff posted here while I still can.
Today’s reviews are from Charles de Lint’s Newford series. If you are a fan of urban fantasy and you haven’t read any of the Newford books, you are seriously missing out. The series consists of novels and anthologies of short stories but I am going to focus on some of my favorite novels today and save the short stories for another time.
Someplace to be Flying
Someplace to be Flying is one of my favorite Newford books and, truth be told, one of my favorite books overall. If I had to recommend only one book to introduce a new reader to Newford, this would be the one. It really is de Lint at his best, creating a fascinating urban fantasy world where mythic, shapeshifting “First People” walk modern city streets. But it is characters that really shine here, characters like the Crow Girls and Jack Daw, that you can’t help falling in love with.
Promises to Keep / The Onion Girl / Widdershins
One of Newford’s MVPs is Jilly Coopercorn, an big-hearted artist with knack for seeing magical things in unlikely places. Some of the best Newford stories revolve around Jilly and her friends. Yet Jilly’s life has had its dark periods too. She has a history of abuse, of addiction and pain that she has never quite dealt with. These three books: Promises to Keep, The Onion Girl and Widdershins are a sort of trilogy that chronicle Jilly’s life and recovery in a way that could only be done in Newford. There are times when the books get a little rough to read – and I don’t recommend reading The Onion Girl without having Widdershins on standby – but they are incredible books in an incredible series and I strongly recommend them.Seafood 101 with Locals Seafood: Clams/
CLAMMER & LOCATION:
Bobby & Susan Cummings, New River, NC
FLAVOR PROFILE:
Firm texture, mild flavor, mild brininess.
SEASONALITY:
You can buy fresh clams all year long.
HOW TO PURGE:
Locals Seafood sells live clams. You can cook and eat them right away, but we recommend purging your clams prior to cooking to guarantee minimal grit if you have the time. To purge, submerge in a solution of 1/3 cup salt to 1 gallon of water for 30 minutes. Change the water and repeat this process 2-3 more times.
HOW TO STORE:
Keep live clams in a bowl or open bag on the top shelf of your refrigerator, where the temperature is warmer (usually around 40 degrees). Do not cover or add fresh water. Use within four days from purchase for best results. If they've popped open, they're no longer any good, so toss them.
HOW TO SHUCK:
If a recipe requires you to shuck clams before cooking, freeze clams for half an hour or more beforehand. To shuck, hold clam and insert clam or pairing knife between the shells and twist knife, cutting around the seal of the shells slowly. Remove the top shell and cut clam out of the bottom shell. Pro tip: drain the remaining broth using a cheesecloth to filter any sediment and save for use in soups and chowders.
FUN FACT:
Clams are, perhaps, one of the most abundant and readily available seafood resources we have in North Carolina. Unless the harvest area is closed due to rain, Locals Seafood can get clams every week of the year. They are arguably underutilized, inexpensive, delicious and healthy, making clams a great option for everyone. You may hear clams named differently — littlenecks, middlenecks, topnecks and chowders — based on their size, though they're all the same species.
INGREDIENTS:
2 dozen clams
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup dry white wine
3/4 tbsp. seafood seasoning (available at Locals Seafood)
1/2 teaspoon of pepper
Melted butter
Lemon wedges
RECIPE:
Serves 2 people.
Scrub clams thoroughly, discarding any shells that are cracked or open.
Combine water, wine, Old Bay seasoning, and pepper in a large Dutch oven. Bring mixture to a boil. Add clams. Cover, reduce heat, and steam until clams open, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove clams with a slotted spoon, reserving liquid. Serve clams hot in shells with reserved clam liquid, melted butter (optional) and lemon wedges.
Pro tip: save the leftover clam liquid for use in your Bloody Mary! for 10 to 15 minutes.

The department of surgical oncology brings to beside the best diagnostic acumen coupled with the state-of-art surgical expertise. Development of superspeciality services in Head and Neck, Gastrointestinal and breast, Thoracic, Urology, Neurosurgery, Gynecology and Orthopedics has further improved the technical excellence in each specialty over the last 12 years. Judious use of radical surgeries has resulted in better cure rates without compromising the quality of life.
Surgical Oncology is one of the biggest departments of BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital. Since the establishment of the hospital, it has been playing a key role in the recognisation in both national and international fields.
The vast experience of over 1400 major and 1500 minor cases in year 2010 has brought an unmatched excellence to the department. It has carried out clinical studies relevant to Nepal, e.g., orthotopic
neobladder, sentinel nodal biopsy in breast cancer, three-field nodal dissection for esophageal cancer, D2- gastrectomy, USG guided brain surgery, various flap reconstruction in head and neck surgery, VATS- laparoscopy assisted esophagectomy, etc.
We have always been very thankful to the government of China for their continuous support to our hospital. Consultants from China have always been good teachers and good friends for us. Department of Surgical Oncology offers a broad array of educational opportunities for surgeons at all levels of training. The department has surgical residents from various medical colleges in general oncosurgery, head and neck surgery and gynaesurgery..
Last year, we could have 3 new appointees, Dr. Dilip Karmacharya, Dr. Arun Sigdel, and Dr. Mukti Devkota. Many of our surgeons continued to participate in various national and international surgical conferences.
In the following paragraphs I would like to mention few new initiatives that have taken place in the last academic year. “Multidisciplinary Cancer Management Course” and 2nd National Oncology Conference was organized (March 5-8, 2010) in collaboration with ASCO. A three day laparoscopic workshop on Gynaecological Oncology was done. Live demonstration of various laparoscopic procedures for Gynaecological tumors were done. We on behalf of the department, thank surgeons from Asan Medical College, Korea (Prof Nam and Dr Nam) and Dr Gyanendra Karki from Biratnagar, Nepal for making this workshop successful. Definitely, we made a great move in regards to minimally acess surgery in year 2010. For the first time in Nepal, our team performed laparoscopic/ VATS esophagectomy.
Despite the financial crisis, provincial deficits and endowment challenges, we have not been idle. Quite the contrary, we have been creative, on budget, successful in research and education, and have forged ahead with our plans to be one of the most innovative and successful departments in the country. I am personally grateful to each and every member of the Department for their hard work, dedication and incredible encouragement and enthusiasm for the initiatives we are undertaking. We look forward to another year of significant achievements and distinctions in our scholarly efforts, training programs and, above all, the care of our patients.On 02/02/2008 06:56 AM, Grant wrote: > I?Find 23108 soil and water conservation offices (SWCS).

For children though, you can't beat printed photos. My wife and I have had a little cardboard box for each of our children which we put various photos in - some duplicate photos from our wedding or when we were children, photos of the children we had framed for a while, pets, all sorts really. The children love sitting with the photos, asking questions about them, asking who some of the people in the photos are.
They also like watching family videos (which obviously is digital) but for me the real joy they get is from touching and holding the photos. Technology evolution is not a solution to everything.
So get printing!!!

I'm going to say this with a bit of caution and a bit of pride-- I had an "interesting week" to say the least-- i have had a crash course in #ILLUMINATI #NWO #ZIONISM #BlackOps #PsyOps and #Mossad-- they are gone now [sorta] but while this was happening a DEAD BODY was found next door. Let me assure you, I am neither dead nor missing-- and unless you hear it from ME - don't let town criers throw #FalseFlags. Furthermore, these people mean business. I have never been more sure of that than I am right now. And they are all over Twitter AND FaceBook. I asked Michael to remove someone from this group beuause he was creating a distraction and false flags on twitter, Michael complied, and for that I am grateful.
Can I get 10-4 / OVER from anybody?
I AM NOT MIND CONTROLLED -- and I will not steer you wrong -- unless you deserve it ;-)

Writing about faith communities
Journalists don’t always get much respect. Sometimes it is their own fault. (If a reporter stuck a microphone in your face after a maniac had shot up your child’s classroom, and asked you, artlessly, “So, how do you feel right now?,” you might not give the journalist high marks.)
The exceptions noted, most journalists try to do good and valuable work. And lacking their tenacity in the face of many obstacles, we’d be the poorer.
There is a special breed of journalist that deserves some attention. They research, write, and report about the faith community. “Religion journalism” is a special calling. One can’t do it properly without some grounding in — and respect for — the church, and without developing a balance between healthy skepticism and sympathy for those about whose world they report.
One can identify three categories of “religion journalists.”
There are those who report on religion for the secular press (such as for a commercial newspaper, like the Pioneer Press or the Star Tribune). These folks may have no particular loyalty to a religious community, and may even be non-religious themselves (although they are generally willing to steer a neutral course when covering the religion scene).
There are those who write for a religious “house organ” (such as The Lutheran [ELCA], The Lutheran Witness [LCMS], The Lutheran Ambassador [AFLC], The Lutheran Spokesman [CLC], or Forward in Christ [WELS]). Their responsibility is to inform the constituents of the denomination, but they are also committed to casting their employing organization in the best possible light. This may tempt them to become “public relations agents” for their employers — unless they can secure a long-enough leash, as some actually do, to report the unvarnished truth.
There are those who report for the independent church news sources. Notable examples are the Roman Catholic National Catholic Reporter, the pan-Lutheran Metro Lutheran, the ecumenical nonprofit magazine Sojourners, or a news service like the nonprofit Religion News Service.
The publication you are reading right now has benefited from those with experience in all three venues. Here are examples:
* Writers for commercial media: Willmar Thorkelson, long-time religion writer for the Minneapolis Star, turned his energies in retirement to writing for Metro Lutheran. Almost until his death in 2002, he was a regular correspondent for the paper. Likewise, the late Clark Morphew, who crafted religion stories for the St. Paul Pioneer Press, wrote for Metro Lutheran in his last years. Morphew in particular earned a reputation, at the St. Paul daily, for taking on the church establishment when he thought its leadership was being less than forthcoming on a particular issue.
* Writers for denominational house organs: Wilfred Bockelman, who lives in retirement in the Twin Cities, was a long-time staff journalist for the American Lutheran Church’s house organ, The Lutheran Standard. He received the Metro Lutheran Gold Pen Award (1997), as did Thorkelson (1989) and Morphew (1992). Another Gold Pen winner, a previous editor of Metro Lutheran, Charles P. Lutz, cut his teeth as a journalist editing One, a magazine for Lutheran youth, when on the staff of both the “old” and the “new”American Lutheran Church. Metro Lutheran editor emeritus Mike Sherer previously served as an editor, and then a communication director, for agencies of the American Lutheran Church and, later, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (as well as for an independent publisher of religious books and magazines).
* Writers for independent religion publications: A journalist who has written primarily for the alternative religious press is the present editor of Metro Lutheran. Bob Hulteen was a associate editor for many years at Sojourners before accepting his current position, and still is a contributing writer there.
A dedicated life
One stand-out communicator followed a completely different path. Robert Ylvisaker, who died in December of 2012, pursued a career in secular journalism before becoming a religion writer in retirement. A graduate of Luther College and the University of Minnesota, Bob spent decades as a reporter for the The Gazette of Cedar Rapids, Iowa; the Rochester (Minnesota) Post-Bulletin, and the Minneapolis Tribune (later merged with the Minneapolis Star). He completed his pre-retirement career by editing a newspaper in the Camden neighborhood of North Minneapolis.
Religion journalists research, write, and report about the faith community.
A humorous (and, in some ways, embarrassing) moment for the writer of this article came scarcely a week into my tenure as the new editor of Metro Lutheran. I recall the day Ylvisaker walked into the editorial office at the Minnesota Church Center in Minneapolis. A recent arrival from Ohio, I had no knowledge of him or his recent significant career in secular journalism. (Because he was an Ylvisaker, I sensed he probably had a Lutheran pedigree, but I knew one should never assume anything. I later learned he had previously served on the Metro Lutheran board of directors, adding to my chagrin.)
In that early encounter with Bob, he announced to me, in his usual modest — almost self-effacing — manner, “I’d like to write for the paper.” I was caught off guard. I didn’t know whether he was a decent writer, nor whether it would be the kind of writing Metro Lutheran really wanted and needed. My plan, by then just recently formulated, was going to be to seek out writers on the recommendation of those “in the media world.” I had received no such recommendation for Bob.
So I decided to put him through the fire. I told him I’d give him an assignment and that, if it turned out well, we’d consider using his talents more in the future. On the spot I concocted the most difficult assignment I could envision. It was early September, and Minnesota was ramping up for election season. I told Bob I wanted a story in which he would report on every election race, from mayor on up to U.S. House, in which a Lutheran was a candidate (and, if two Lutherans were facing off, all the better). I wanted a “roundup story.” I figured if an assignment of that magnitude didn’t scare him off, he was either foolish or highly skilled. (I had no knowledge just then of the fact that Bob had been a crack political reporter for a local daily.)
His response, as I recall, was, “Sure. I can do that. When do you need it?”
The story he turned in was better than I’d expected. It was also very long. It served me right. I had asked for comprehensive treatment of a complicated topic. It was the first story I included in Metro Lutheran under Bob Ylvisaker’s byline, but far from the last.
Religion journalists who are worth their salt maintain their commitment to the dual task of “speaking the truth … in love.”
In terms of story length, it soon became clear to me that Bob liked to “write long.” The other staff writers began to notice that Bob’s stories were always more comprehensive than theirs (and chided me for allowing it, since I’d asked everyone to condense their submissions). I confronted Bob about this. He cheerfully replied, “I’m sorry. I keep trying to keep the stories as short as you want them. But when I was ‘in the business’ we were taught to write in such a way that you answer every possible question the reader might legitimately ask on the topic at hand.’”
Who was I to argue with a trained professional steeped in his craft? After that, I resorted to printing portions of Bob’s stories and running the longer version on Metro Lutheran’s website. He informed me that he thought that was a creative solution. (A less generous journalist would have taken me to task, or perhaps even thrown a tantrum. Not Bob.)
How different is that?
The ALC’s The Lutheran Standard (a predecessor to the ELCA’s The Lutheran), consistently ran a biblical quote underneath the masthead at the top of page one. It read, “Speaking the truth in love.” Religion journalists who are worth their salt maintain their commitment to that dual task. It will not serve the readership well to sugar-coat, obfuscate, mislead, or under-report a story. Speaking the truth means just that — getting the facts in front of the audience and trusting them to draw appropriate conclusions.
But unlike the secular media, religion journalists also take seriously their responsibility to tell their stories “in love” — that is, compassionately.
The one-time (now retired) editor of The Lutheran Church in America publication, The Lutheran (later the editor of the ELCA journal by the same name), explained this calling memorably in a workshop for church journalists. Edgar Trexler said, “I once attended a Lutheran church assembly at which a pastor was escorted from the plenary meeting, in full view of the entire gathering, by the local police. The next day the local secular media reported he’d been solicited for sex by an undercover agent on a public street, and had responded inappropriately.”
Said Trexler, “We could have ignored or buried the story. But we decided to report it with compassion. So we talked about how the pastor’s congregation and his synod ministered to him just then.” That was a great example of “speaking the truth in love” if ever there was one.
Martin Luther reminded his church to celebrate vocation (calling) in all its forms. He said a shoemaker and a bishop were on equal footing before God, assuming both did their task with integrity. The same is true for journalists.
Those who report for the church and its members exercise a special calling. They are worthy of our appreciation.

Well known for his precision and fidelity to the Club’s mission, Bruce has been an indispensable member of the Washington Group’s Board of Directors since 1995 and has been reelected as the Washington Group’s Treasurer every year for the past eighteen years. The highly successful Washington Group’s student grant program can largely be attributed to Bruce’s sharp pencil and budget process which has led to over $200,000 to more than one hundred graduate students throughout mid-Atlantic region. His annual financial statements make the Washington Group a poster child for financial management and transparency. Bruce’s persistence helped boost the percentage of dues paying members from thirty to eighty percent and he prepares and publishes the Group’s unique annual membership directory.
Mr. Blanchard received two degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology followed by forty eight years in the U.S. Department of the Interior, ultimately serving in several senior executive positions. He worked for eight Secretaries of the Interior and personally provided oversight for hundreds of significant environmental issues. Other positions included Deputy Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Special Assistant for Tribal Self Governance. During his career he received the Department’s highest awards for meritorious and distinguished service.
Mr. Blanchard was born on a little horse cavalry post in the Philippines and grew up on several army posts. Over the years he has received many honors from MIT, DOI, and the U.S. Army.

More kids arrested after photo of student with gun is circulated with threat online
PLAQUEMINE – Additional arrests have been made related to a picture circulated on the internet that caused a panic at an area school last week.
The Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office said two students were charged with disturbing the peace by alarming the public for their role in the scare. Already, a young student was charged with felony terrorizing charges related to the situation.
The image was a post on social media showing the student who was initially charged wearing a bandana over his face and holding a rifle. The boy sent the picture – without a caption or message – to others who then forwarded it on to the two kids arrested most recently. It was the last pair, the sheriff's office said, that added a threatening line.
The students and the threat were associated with Iberville public school MSA West. All are 8th graders at the school, sources said.
WBRZ.com was first to report the situation last week. Then, students and parents described an atmosphere of chaos and concern as news of the threat spread, though the sheriff said there was never any danger.
"People are real nervous," Sophomore Ty Robinson said. "One girl was having a panic attack and everyone else was calling their parents to come get them."
Names of those charged have not been released. WBRZ has made an editorial decision to blur the image of the child's face.
Sheriff Brett Stassi said when deputies learned of the picture last week, they went to the student's house. Investigators took the guns and the student was not able to attend school. The guns belonged to the student's father.

… and a day that should have been a day of celebration turned into a day of remorse and mourning… I knew there was something more important for today’s post to be dedicated to.
I was not old enough to understand 9/11. I remember the chaos and the repeated showings on the news of skyscrapers falling. I was confused and didn’t know what was going on. But now that I’m older and have witnessed the bombing of Boston…. If 9/11 was anything like the bombing in Boston, I know we need each other to get through this.
I may not live in Boston, but Boston is still a part of this country – a part of home. We are all children of a loving Heavenly Father. We are brothers and sisters. We as a nation and as a people (whether here in the states or across the seas) can come together and help our brothers and sisters in Boston.
Please pray for the victims in Boston. Pray for their families and for those who have lost loved ones. Pray for peace in the world. Pray for love among men. ❤ ❤ ❤
Alone we fall. Together we stand.

Great post, Kat 🙂
SO sad 😦
I remember 9/11 like it was yesterday and all those mixed feelings that i had about it all. I really do feel like it changed the world!
Hopefully we, as a nation, can learn from it and use it, making it a blessing instead of a roadblock. Even the little things really add up. We can become more considerate of others. We can reach out, serve others, and become a friend to our neighbors. We can lift each other up. And, we can do what we can to prevent something like this from happening again. This bombing was awful, but doing nothing about it is worse.UPDATE: Saturday November 2nd

I opened this one back in July or August after buying it during my day-trip to Hudson last spring. It could have gone bad sitting in my basement all summer at 65* but honestly this is a 9% brew and many other lower alcohol brews have withstood these conditions without ill effect. Bad bottle.

As for your mental and spiritual preparation, getting involved in the religion which you’re believed in is a good idea. This may not be everyone’s thing, but it’s highly recommended. Aside from giving you a peaceful state of mind, the religion’s teachings may motivate you and also give you more sense of purpose even for your retirement days.South Korea has awarded Raytheon Company a $769.4 million contract for an upgraded Patriot Air and Missile Defense System, the nation announced Monday.
This upgrade allows for improved detection of targets and improved user interfaces that use touchscreen technology. It also has open network architecture so that it can operate on a multitude of network configurations.
"The upgrade enhances the Republic of Korea's defenses and underscores the value of the 13-nation strong Patriot partnership which funded development of the modernization," Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems President Dan Crowley said. "The Republic of Korea's procurement is also an economic growth engine which will bring good jobs to Korea and preserve jobs in the U.S which would have gone overseas if a foreign system was selected."
Previously, the South Korean government awarded the company a $160 million contract in order to upgrade its missiles to the improved GEM-T configuration.
According to Raytheon, the Patriot system air and missile defense system is able to eliminate and protect against ballistics, unmanned aircraft and other threats of that nature.
The company focuses on a range of services in defense and security markets.Toggle navigation

The title of her presentation will be “Saving The Overberg’s Renosterveld: Can we stop the extinction spiral?”
Dr Odette Curtis Odette is hard at work trying to preserve the critically endangered survivors.
“It’s estimated that there’s less than between 4 and 6% of the Renosterveld left,” says Curtis. Even this is an optimistic estimate; the true figure could be significantly lower, she says.
The remaining Renosterveld is highly fragmented, with fewer than 50 fragments larger than 100 ha. Almost all Renosterveld remnants occur on privately owned land, creating an additional challenge for conservation.
All these factors, coupled with the large range of endemic and threatened plants and animals inhabiting this bio-hotspot, make the unique Renosterveld one of the most threatened habitats on earth. This puts it in urgent need of conservation attention.
Odette holds an MSc in Zoology (2005) and a PhD in Botany (2013) from the University of Cape Town (UCT). She has authored or co-authored eight scientific papers and fourteen popular articles. She was invited as a Leadership Intern to Hawk Mountain Sanctuary, Pennsylvania, USA, for two months in 2005.
Odette managed the Black Harrier (Witkruis-vleivalk) and Black Sparrowhawk (Swartsperwer) Projects from 2000-2006 at UCT; undertook a pilot study on gamebirds in Renosterveld (2007), and was contracted by Cape Nature’s Stewardship Programme from 2007-2011. She also initiated research on Renosterveld management since 2007 (funded by the World Wildlife Fund from 2007-2011).
Since being appointed Director of the Overberg Renosterveld Conservation Trust, she has made her home in Napier in the Overberg.
The meeting, in the Fernkloof Reserve Hall, begins at 19:00. We are back in summer time.

Scheduled for a 1 p.m. EST kickoff this game will be aired on CBS where available.
Mark Sanchez will start for the Jets, a week after he was benched for third-string quarterback Greg McElroy. McElroy led the Jets to a 7-6 win against Arizona but will again be the third string option this week should Tim Tebow’s ribs be healthy. The Jets are a mess on both sides of the ball as their once great defense has showed signs of aging and injuries this season falling to 22nd in the league in points allowed.
Jacksonville named Chad Henne the starter a few weeks ago. Henne has had a couple of good games and a stinker last week. The Jaguars remain without Maurice Jones Drew and their defense is allowing 28.5 points per game.
Despite all the points these teams give up its hard to expect a lot of scoring because of how bad their offenses are.
So whats the spread in the Jets and Jaguars game? Most places have the Jets favored in this one by 3 points. The over/under is listed at 38.5 points.Fire Tornado in Slow Motion 4K – The Slow Mo Guys

ELULA means simple in Zulu and this beautifully textured, short necklace, is made up of simple elements that are stitched together. There are 2 tricky areas that will put a bit of strain on your needles but, it is so worth that little bit of effort. As in so many of my patterns, once you have the necklace beaded, you will want to create an elegant bracelet to go with it and then, a stunning pair of earrings as well, ELULA works up very quickly and will, at most, take you maximum 2 days, if not 1 to bead up.

Techniques: Circular Peyote and Picot stitch
Material requirements: 11o and 15o seed beads, Super Duo beads, 6mm round beads
An.After spending so much time at La Petite Maison, on what is virtually a building site, the renovations are starting to wear me down; physically, mentally and emotionally. Time to have a break from all this “doing” I think.
One of the best ways to recover after a day’s dirty work is to indulge in a long hot soak in the bath. I love to lay in a bath with herbs and flower petals infusing around me in the water, releasing their soothing scents.
Lavender and Chamomile
(harvested from the allotment)
have a soothingly soporific effect, helping to relax my aching muscles, whilst Calendula, Rose Petals and even oats work their healing powers to repair my much battered and suffering skin.
I confess though that as romantic as it may appear at first with petals floating on top of the water, emerging from the bath with oats or chamomile flowers sticking to various damp patches of skin is not desirable and so I tend to contain the herbs in little organza or muslin bags which I let infuse in the bath water.
I should perhaps mention that my Lavender bath soaks are best used at the end of the day, when the next item on the agenda is sleep. The almost narcotic effect of the bath soaks can be detrimental to any planned activities, as Susan’s mum found out to her cost when she had a herbal bath on Christmas morning; resulting in dinner being prepared by Susan while her mum lay comatose and snoozing in an armchair.
There is another way of enjoying a Herbal Bath that ever since I saw the episode of River Cottage when herbalist Eleanor Gallia filled a bath for Hugh Fernley Whittingstall with herbs and flowers in the water - outside in her herb garden at Nethercerne Farm, I have thought how lovely it would be to bathe in the open air surrounded by trees, herbs and wildflowers.
Can you imagine how gorgeous a herbal bath in the above settings would be?
Aside from our unreliable climate - with copious amounts of rain falling unpredictably and the currently unappealing surroundings of builder debris, practicalities would prevent this from taking place at La Petite Maison however. I have no desire to flaunt myself where ogling neighbourhood eyes (hitherto screened off, prior to the removal of the mature trees in the garden by the Elder-of-the-Much-Appreciated-Men-Folk) may now inadvertently peer gazing in horror not only at my nudity (shudder) but also at the huge ignominious bruises where I recently bashed myself on the scaffolding and which look as if I have received a rather bad beating.
I should just interject here and suggest that there is somewhere ideal for this type of bathing experience and that is beside a certain “Lavender Walk” in the Perth Hills,
which if La Petite Maison ever reaches fruition is where I may find myself jetting off to for some much needed recuperation to stay with Sister Ruby aka Francois. But that is not likely to happen this month unfortunately!
So the other day I found myself setting off for a different type of soak. A soak with a seaside theme! No it was not a swim in the sea; although the benefits of the sea are captured with this form of bathing - but without having the worry of jellyfish or the icy chill of the water and the horrifying possibility of encountering something unpleasant from a local sewage plant floating by. Instead this form of bath involves seaweed and has to be one of the most therapeutic and relaxing baths I have experienced.
I have been known to occasionally gather seaweed from the shore, but that is mainly for use on the allotment, as seaweed makes excellent fertiliser and keeps slugs at bay; for my bath today the seaweed had already been gathered fresh that morning and washed at the Seaweed Baths where I was heading, by Dermot – the co-owner.
Seaweed bathing became popular in by-gone times when farmers collecting seaweed to use as a soil conditioner noticed the hacks and calluses on their hands healed as they handled the seaweed.
As I drove past the bay the sun glinted on the water, but as I reached the Seaweed Baths clouds had gathered over the mountains and the sea took on a grey tint. The first spots of rain were beginning to fall as I got out of the car.
The Bathhouse staff were welcoming as usual and when the room was ready, after warming up first for several minutes in the Steam cubicle, I slid into the huge roll top bath amongst the floating seaweed and felt the heat from the water seep into my skin.
Apparently the steam session and the hot water dilate the pores and blood vessels, allowing the skin to be more receptive to the minerals and vitamins from the bath.
The heat releases the seaweeds essential oils leaving the skin smooth and helps lower body stress and relieve skin conditions (psoriasis, eczema, acne etc). It has also been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of muscle aches and joint stiffness (rheumatism and arthritis), and excellent for some circulatory problems.
A pleasant smell emanated from the bath; salty and wholesome as I lay submerged like a mermaid with only my nose above the water and I felt all the stresses and tensions slip away as I swished the slippery silky seaweed around the water.
After my bath was over – (the forty five minutes were gone before I knew it), feeling revitalised and rejuvenated I set off for home, having purchased a packet of dried seaweed for home use and which I shall enjoy following the next exhausting day at La Petite Maison. Until that time I will carry on with the seaweed theme and make use of my homemade Sea Garden Soap with its special addition of Kelp.

Added at: 2013-03-31 16:52Death is the great equalizer, and all change is heat death, a.k.a. entropy.
Mastering Empathy
in Psionics Mastering empathy would at first be especially daunting, because as much as our intellect would like to just restructure and redefine our every faculty, our bodies fortunately won’t let us go too far too easily, and a potential active emapth would have to learn to respect the internal landscape. It takes discipline which is especially hard as the uncontrolled activity of the empath’s talent is often very uncomfortable. They have to be willing to temper something that you may have convinced yourself is just self, just who you are. It may even feel like you are attacking yourself but really you’re just attacking old pointlessly restrictive bonds. Once those are severed, the resulting emotional freedom is quite a relief. It is a big challenge.
But moving on from there, you come to see emotional energy as a resource like water or heat. You can learn to gather and store this resource, focusing it into useful systems like healing or physical augmentation. It tends to be difficult to channel into more “cerebral” pathways as it never takes on a structure that is very compatible with computational process.
But most natural empaths wouldn’t be much disturbed by that limitation anyway. Some people even accidentally develop an actual system of applied empathy. That person who is always the calming influence wherever they go, or the person who always enlivens a fun loving mood, is always described as “the life of the party” even when their own behaviour isn’t that wild and festive. They may be quite calm and relaxed, but subconsciously everyone finds reasons to explain why that person feels fun to be around.
An empath will have trouble meditating. They have more success with it when they can externalize it, linger in meditative environments, or participate in meditative ritualized activities. Zen sand raking is great for them.
So are they both introverts and extroverts? Indeed, empaths can be either introverted or extroverted depending on how they feel most comfortable trying to cope with their sub-cognitive experience of the environment.
Sometimes both. I myself am ambivert. I test that way even when I’m trying not to. I guess it’s why people think I must be having a grand old time when I talk or do talks. I guess my motives would be hard to read, harder than someone who is more naturally one way or the other.
Well, you have explained them to us. Yes, though explanation can be more alienating than bridge building. Like having to explain a joke something is lost in the effort to connect. It might seem less genuine to the person who it was explained to.
Have I explained emapths adequately? Is it helpful or useful in some way I hope?
Yes it is. It reminded me of quite a few friends. They tend to be attracted to groups like this though focusing and making headway in these practices is often hard and frustrating for them.
Your thoughts are welcome. Be well friends.

Bryan and Lily took her at various points to see both daughters, grand daughter and great-grandchildren which Ma would have loved. So yesterday she was in an ok mood for most of the day and ate reasonably well. I did have to jolly her along for a while and persuade her out of going to bed at half 6, but that's about all.
This morning she was all for wearing shorts and a backless top on the greyest coolest day we've had and would not be persuaded otherwise. After wandering in the garden with the dog for a few minutes she then appeared in a velour tracksuit, fleece and woolly socks! Sue arrived for my Carer's Assessment meeting so I sorted Ma's breakfast and we went to sit in a different room to Ma because she was watching tv and we needed a bit of quiet to fill in the forms. This didn't go down very well unfortunately. After Sue had left I found Ma in the living room wearing her coat and shivering. I asked her why she hadn't put the heater on (something she can still manage to do) and was told, in that particular tone of voice that it didn't matter. Although I knew, I asked what was wrong and she stated that she didn't think it was right and that she should be around when I was discussing her. When I said that actually we were talking about me and my needs not her I could tell that she didn't believe me. The only thing I can do at times like these is to be quietly assertive and repeat what I've said, without heat, until she accepts what I'm saying. It can take a while...
She's just had a toasted cheese and tomato sandwich and a hot chocolate and is quite happy again, dozing in front of the news.

But without all the farting around which has crept in, making it very-not-low-carb-at-all and therefore makes-you-fat-very-quickly-and-efficiently. So with that in mind... for brunch I did a really gorgeous frittata with chorizo, courgette, feta, mint and basil. Then I poached a large chook in the afternoon. Ma had it with new potatoes and a few veggies. I had it with courgettes, leeks and celery in a cream and stilton sauce.
Courgettes are likely to feature highly for the next few days because I came back from Cornwall with a carrier bag full of them courtesy of JT! I also stripped the chicken carcass and shoved it in the stock pot with the usual suspects and then left it in the bottom of the Aga overnight. Easiest way I know to make proper stock :) So some sort of soup is on the agenda. I rather fancy cauliflower. Maybe. Or...watercress and celery. Or spinach and stilton. Or all of them!
Breakfast was a couple of sausages, a few very thin slices of tomato dressed with a little salt and a few drips of cider vinegar and a slice of lovely slumped Brie.
Lunch will be chicken, coleslaw, gherkins, green salad and cheese.
Just about to cook a piece of ham for later. Not sure what I'll do with it yet.
Good old JT!!!

A new book co-edited by Burt Kimmelman, professor of English at New Jersey Institute of Technology, has garnered accolades for examining how Guillaume de Machaut’s work as a medieval poet influenced the craft of story-telling long after the Middle Ages.
The collection of scholarly essays, titled Machaut’s Legacy: The Judgment Poetry Tradition in the Later Middle Ages and Beyond, explores how the poet’s innovative approaches to literary form led ultimately to the development of the novel, influencing authors towards the end of the medieval epoch, and on even into the postmodern era.
“Guillaume de Machaut, in our time better known as a great musician and composer, was also a prolific and innovative author; only now is his extensive sway over younger writers being fully recognized,” said Kimmelman, whose new book has already received acclaim from world-renowned scholars excited about the volume’s entirely new approach to understanding the origins of narrative after the fourteenth century, then the Renaissance, and onward to our own time.
“This richly erudite volume contextualizes Machaut as a seminal medieval poet whose work extends its reach well into the modern era,” said Lynn T. Ramey, author of Black Legacies: Race and the European Middle Ages. Jacqueline Cerquiglini-Toulet, author of A New History of Medieval French Literature, considers various medieval literary forms when describing Machaut’s Legacy as “an ambitious work that seeks, with great acuity, the origin of the kind of ‘novel’ in the dit and not in the romaunt.”
Calling the book “truly brilliant,” William Calin, author of The Lily and the Thistle: The French Tradition and the Older Literature of Scotland, explains that Machaut’s Legacy “makes a claim to a paradigm shift in how we envisage the history of literature.”
Kimmelman has previously received recognition for nine published collections of poetry, which have been featured on National Public Radio, recited by Garrison Keillor. His monograph, The Poetics of Authorship in the Later Middle Ages (1996, 1999), continues to be referenced by scholars in the field. He teaches literary and cultural studies in NJIT’s Humanities department.
"Machaut’s Legacy was published by the University Press of Florida; it was co-edited by R. Barton Palmer, Calhoun Lemon Professor of Literature at Clemson University.An introductory course that trains students to become community health workers (CHW) who assist individuals and communities in adopting and maintaining positive health behaviors.

NewSermon: Psalm 66:1-12--"Praising God"
Worship
A Call to Universal Worship
Psalm 66
Read the entire psalm.
This morning we’ll be studying verses 1-12 together. Students of the Old Testament classify this section of the psalm as a hymn of praise to the God who created and chose Israel.
Next week we’ll complete this psalm together by looking at verses 13-20: the psalmist’s individual song of thanksgiving.
My purpose today is simple and two-fold: (1) to encourage you to praise God both for Who He is and for what He has done, and (2) to exhort you to tell others about the great works of the LORD.
I. The call to universal worship shows that
A. The praise director/psalmist had a “world vision” (v. 1)-Note: Earth
He meant all the peoples on Earth (cf. v. 4). From the beginning God desired the people of Israel to spread the faith, not remain silent and keep it to themselves, not place their lamp under a bushel basket. The Abrahamic promise of Genesis 12 states: “. . . in you (Abraham) all the families (people-groups) of the Earth shall be blessed.” So, peoples worldwide would benefit from God’s blessings upon Abraham and Israel.
And they have benefited, despite Israel’s partial obedience to this commission. Let’s pick out some examples from OT history, and think about them for a few moments.
As we turn to the NT, the Jews are still an apostate nation. When the Pharisees made converts, for instance, they really botched it up. What did Jesus say about them? Matthew 23:15
How has the true Church done throughout history?
William Carey and elders—“Sit down, young man. When God decides to save the heathen, He will do so without your help or ours.”
How about us today? Are we “world Christians”? Are we concerned enough about “people-groups” to learn about them and then support missions that seek to meet their need of salvation?
Regarding making a “joyful shout”: In public worship, it does not mean that we should let loose with an emotional, uncontrolled outburst. Our emotions should be relatively free, yes, but not unrestrained. Most worshipers show their emotions to some degree. That’s good. But some folks seem to let their emotions rule rather than control them with their mind and will. That’s not good.
Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 14:15 that he should pray and sing not only with the spirit, but also with the understanding. We must make sure that the Holy Spirit of wisdom, not just our merely human desires and feelings, enables our worship. The apostle concludes his instruction by saying that everything in a church service should be done decently and in order (14:40)
I quote from Point 5 of our “Philosophy of Ministry”:
Worship services must seek to magnify God’s attributes as well as equip believers with truth so that they might serve Christ acceptably
Our local church must focus our attention upon the Lord Jesus, not upon our leaders. We gather as a corporate body to declare His worthiness to receive praise, glory, and obedience, not to meet the felt needs of “seekers” or even of church members. If our services guide us to view the Lord accurately, we will grow to worship Him with a sincere heart wherever we might go.
When we as a local church listen obediently to God’s word, pray together, and sing praises to the Lord, we are engaged in worship. However, we also worship Jesus when we as individuals reverently read and study the Bible, petition and praise Him, love others sacrificially, give of our “time, talents, and treasures,” work our “secular” jobs “as unto the Lord,” and “share” the gospel with the unsaved. Our corporate worship on Sunday should overflow to our private worship during the other days of the week.
We should not allow methods of entertainment, musical style, decibel level, stated expectations of others, emotionalism, or weak or errant theology to inhibit individual worship in our church services. Music should exhibit “balance,” having Christ-centered, theologically sound lyrics that reflect the character of God. It should “come alongside” believers and help them praise the Savior; their personal taste in music should not matter.
TS: (Secondly,
Praising God for Who He Is
B. The psalmist wants everyone to praise God for who He is (v. 2).
The term “name” here refers to His revealed attributes. It’s not enough, however, just to know about God’s attributes. As J. I. Packer has well said, “A little knowledge of God is worth more than a great deal of knowledge about Him.” Our contemplation of what is true about God should move us to praise Him for Who He is.
What does it mean to “sing out the glory of His name and make his praise glorious?”
John Calvin offers a well-phrased explanation of these commands: “We should extol His sacred name in a manner suitable to its dignity, so that it [His sacred name] may obtain its due and deserved adoration. We should celebrate His goodness in some measure proportionally to its excellence.”
TS: (Furthermore, a third sub-point sees
C. The psalmist telling his audience to acknowledge God’s awe-inspiring power while they stand before Him (vv. 3-4).
1. They should enumerate His “awesome deeds” (Read 65:5-13). “God is of such a nature that He cannot be “captured” by the human mind nor analyzed by the investigation of any mortal (Deut. 29:29)
2. They should confess that God (Elohim) will cause His enemies to make a show of feigned obedience (NASB) [See Phil. 2:9-11].
3. They should state that God will one day bring about universal victory and praise in the Messianic kingdom (v. 4) [Zech. 14:16- “and it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the king, the LORD of hosts, . . .”]
End of verse 4 is selah: a rest or musical interlude. Israel would play and sing a hymn at this point.
TS: (A second major point finds the psalmist exhorting his Israelite audience to
Recall God's Works on Your Behalf
II. Recall God’s works on their behalf (vv. 5-7).
Notice that the focus has narrowed from universal praise to praise among Israelites.
A. The psalmist exhorts the worshiping community to “come and see” (5-6b)
Here he is acting as a presenter or a professional song leader, inviting his listeners to attend a dramatic presentation of some of God’s more awesome works. These performances would take place during Israel’s great annual festivals and have the purpose of teaching the generation to follow about their God.
While the Church today should not major on drama as a means to spread the gospel, neither should we neglect this scriptural method of teaching others about the most significant events in Israel’s history. [Dean Jones’ presentation, “The Hiding Place”]
1. Vs. 6a alludes to what event? Red Sea
2. Vs. 6b alludes to what event? The Crossing of the Jordan on foot
TS: (Next,
B. The psalmist instructs his audience to imitate their ancestors (v. 6c). Instead of “will rejoice”-better translated as “rejoiced.” He exhorts them at this point to do the same.
1. The sad report of Judges 2:10
2. Will the next generation know how to rejoice because of our testimony?
C. The psalmist further asserts God’s attributes to help Israel praise Him (v. 7)
1. Sovereign kingship-- “rule”--universal
2. Omnipotence-- “power” from word meaning “mighty warrior”
3. Eternality-- “forever”
4. Omnipresence-- God has no physical eyes, but He still sees (lit. spies). He plays the watchman for Israel for the purpose of protecting them; He keeps an eye on everything going on, and will not allow the rebellious to exalt themselves forever. “God’s acts in history bring joy to the faithful, but stand as a warning to the rebel.”
Selah (v. 7)
TS: (In a third major point, the psalmist exhorts his Israelite brethren to
Praise God For Deliverance
III. Praise God for deliverance (vv. 8-12)
A. The psalmist tells them to bless God (v. 8).
“Bless” here literally means “adore on bended knee.” Why?
1. He keeps them alive (v. 9a)—Preserves the people from total ruin, politically or otherwise
2. He keeps them stable (v. 9b)—Does not allow them to be moved from a place of safety
TS: (The LORD has preserved Israel and kept them safe, all the while causing them deep suffering.
Notice the direct address: “O God”
B. The psalmist reminds Israel what the LORD has done to them as well as for them (vv. 10-12).
1. He has tested them (v. 10)--made a thorough searching of their hearts; closely scrutinized their ways (Ps. 139:23-24)
2. He has refined them--through pressure and heat (v. 10)--removal of dross/impurities from silver (Mal. 3:3)
3. He has captured them (v. 11a)—put them in a situation from which they could not escape by themselves. Speaks of total loss of freedom.
4. He has afflicted them (v. 11b)—caused them pain through pressure. Lit. Upon their loins: the seat of keenest pain.
5. He has allowed them to suffer (v. 12a)—enemies exercised tyranny over them (oppression). “Fire and water” signify extreme danger and complicated calamities.
6. But He has liberated them (v. 12b)—the goal of the purification process. He delivered them into a place of abundance (liberation).
The Lesson of Chastening
God is in control of the refining process. He chastens, but He also comforts (Heb. 12:10-11)
Summarize purpose: (1) Praise God for who He is and for what He has done for you; (2) Tell others about what He has done for you and for all those who trust in Him.

Scripture
‘When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, whoever enters by the north gate to worship is to go out the south gate; and whoever enters by the south gate is to go out the north gate. No one is to return through the gate by which he entered, but each is to go out the opposite gate. (Ezekiel 46:9)
Observation
God cares about details. He not only cares about building construction and sacrifices but also where people enter and exit during feasts. Worship is holy and sacred.
Application
God provides us with no such specifications regarding contemporary worship in the post-Acts 2 Church. We are not under the Law, yet God never changes so the instructions we do have must be taken seriously. To know the Word, we must read and study it…and let it study us!
Prayer
Father, thank You for Your love for us and Your concern about every detail in our lives. I praise You for being a God of order and design. Creation is filled with nearly infinite examples of Your unique attention to detail. Help me to see those things in my life that demand more attention in order to glorify You.

Stuart McColm, general manager, Castle Stuart Golf Links
We are keenly anticipating further announcements on the line-up for the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open at Castle Stuart this summer.
Confirmation that Phil Mickelson, Henrik Stenson and Graeme McDowell will join local hero Russell Knox at the tournament has provoked worldwide interest and we are confident that many more of the world’s top players will be on the plane to the Highlands come July.
Mickelson, a five-time Major winner, and Stenson, the current world number 5, will renew old rivalries at Castle Stuart. The Swede led by two shots going into the final day in 2013, but it was Mickelson who picked up the trophy after defeating Branden Grace in a play-off. The climax of the tournament reached a worldwide television audience of more than 500 million, including weekend live coverage on NBC USA.
McDowell, winner of the 2010 US Open and 2008 Scottish Open, is another outstanding addition to this year’s field. We are delighted that these high-profile champion golfers have committed to playing at Castle Stuart and we are looking forward to the next set of players confirming their intentions to play.
If they need any encouragement, then history shows that Castle Stuart is the place to come to fine tune your game ahead of The Open the following week.
Phil Mickelson won the double in 2013, collecting The Open title a few days after his success on the Moray Firth and cited his success in the Highlands as a key factor in collecting the claret jug for the first time – ahead of runner-up, Henrik Stenson.
“I’m always excited about returning to Scotland, and particularly to Castle Stuart”, he said. “I believe winning there in 2013 was key to my success the next week at The Open Championship.”
Mickelson was the third successive Open champion who played Castle Stuart in the week prior to lifting the famous trophy, although he was the first to win both titles. Ernie Els in 2012 and Darren Clarke in 2011 also prepared for their Major victories by competing in the Scottish Open here.
Castle Stuart provides a true links experience and the perfect environment to prepare for The Open. Our philosophy is based on ‘playability’ and ‘fun’ and, as Henrik Stenson points out, the course doesn’t ‘beat you up’ as much as an Open Championship venue. However, it does provide a real challenge and can crucially get players in the links mind-set.
Three Open champions took the path to glory via the Highlands and those preparing for Royal Troon this year would be wise to follow in their footsteps..

The ancient Chinese treatment is helping some women get pregnant.
"Acupuncture is a proven method of increasing fertility. We used it everyday here at Yenova Center to bring blood to the ovaries, to help potentate a good follicle. We use it to improve blood circulation to the uterus, balance hormones, and reduce inflammation, possibly shorter," licensed acupuncturist Jill Blakeway said.
"A significant number of my patients are benefiting from the therapy, and a good percentage also succeed with a combination approach of acupuncture and assisted reproduction," fertility specialist Dr. Tanmoy Muhkerjee said.
Experts say there are clear cut surgical issues where acupuncture therapies are not useful, and your acupuncturist should refer back to a"Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives."

This is going to be completely unrelated and of hardly any interest to anyone but movie nerds, but it’s been bugging me. It’s my blog after all, so I’ll post whatever I want. Now here is a post about movies.
You may be aware that there has been a recent remake of Alice in Wonderland, directed by Tim Burton, which hit the cinemas last year. I have only recently seen it. The design is incredible, but the kitschy ending somewhat ruined it for me. Anyhow, undoubtedly one of the most memorable parts of the movie is the role of the “Red Queen” aka “Queen of Hearts”. She’s the evil character of the Story, though in a very childlike, vulnerable way.
Now bear with me for a second.
Another movie which I’ve recently seen (again) is The House of 1000 Corpses, a horror flick shot in 2003 by Rob Zombie. It’s a movie about a bunch of teens who get slaughtered by an insane family of murderers and occultists. Here, the most remarkable character of the film is Captain Spaulding, a creepy deranged clown with rotten teeth, played by Sid Haig.
So: Two movies. One a 2010 kid’s movie, the other an R-rated, gory horror flick. Now I’d like you to take a look at the two character’s make-up:
LEFT: The Queen of Hearts, Alice in Wonderland, 2010. RIGHT: Captain Spaulding, The House of 1000 Corpses, 2003.
There’s really only two possible ways to explain this similarity. Either it’s coincidence, and Tim Burton was completely unaware that his wife has just been painted with the make-up of a very famous (albeit fictional) serial killer, or he shot a movie for kids that intentionally contained a reference to an extremely violent and brutal horror film. Both scenarios seem equally unlikely. On the one hand, I just cannot believe that Tim Burton is unaware of the existence of the two Rob Zombie movies for it to be purely coincidental. Plus, just look at it. I mean, it’s the exact same shade of blue, arching up from each eye, until confined by a single black line (same thickness!), while the rest of the face is completely white. Somce coincidence that would be. Did the make-up artist allow himself a joke and Tim Burton didn’t notice? Or is this really Tim Burton giving a nod to Rob Zombie in his version of freakin’ Alice ? That would actually make a lot more sense, except that this is something that might potentially set off the “protect the children!”-reflex of the conservative right, triggering protests, boycotts and attempts at censorship. Why risk that?
Of course I know the correct answer is who gives a fuck?, but for some reason, stuff like this really buggs me.
PS: Other people noticed the make-up, too. This one is also a very nice review of Alice: “this movie is a wonder to look at, but a chore to sit through.” Couldn’t have said it any better.
Sharing is caring! --->

Hahaha, or it was a coincidence because that set of make up is actually not that uncommon in regards to clownish feature. Especially the blue over the eyes which I do believe is being indicated by this article since little else is similar.

Introduction
One of the attractive features of writing MATLAB code is the ease of creating, accessing, modifying and manipulating matrices in MATLAB.
When processing such MATLAB code, HDL Coder maps these matrices to wires or registers in HDL. For example, local temporary matrix variables are mapped to wires, whereas persistent matrix variables are mapped to registers.
The latter tends to be an inefficient mapping when the matrix size is large, since the number of register resources available is limited. It also complicates synthesis, placement and routing.
Modern FPGAs feature block RAMs that are designed to have large matrices. HDL Coder takes advantage of this feature and automatically maps matrices to block RAMs to improve area efficiency. For certain designs, mapping these persistent matrices to RAMs is mandatory if the design is to be realized. State-of-the-art synthesis tools may not be able to synthesize designs when large matrices are mapped to registers, whereas the problem size is more manageable when the same matrices are mapped to RAMs.
MATLAB Design
design_name = 'mlhdlc_sobel'; testbench_name = 'mlhdlc_sobel_tb';
- MATLAB Design: mlhdlc_sobel
- MATLAB Testbench: mlhdlc_sobel_tb
- Input Image: stop_sign
Create a New Folder and Copy Relevant Files
Execute the following lines of code to copy the example files into a temporary folder.
mlhdlc_demo_dir = fullfile(matlabroot, 'toolbox', 'hdlcoder', 'hdlcoderdemos', 'matlabhdlcoderdemos'); mlhdlc_temp_dir = [tempdir 'mlhdlc_sobel']; % create a temporary folder and copy the MATLAB files cd(tempdir); [~, ~, ~] = rmdir(mlhdlc_temp_dir, 's'); mkdir(mlhdlc_temp_dir); cd(mlhdlc_temp_dir); % copy the design files to the temporary directory copyfile(fullfile(mlhdlc_demo_dir, [design_name,'.m*']), mlhdlc_temp_dir); copyfile(fullfile(mlhdlc_demo_dir, [testbench_name,'.m*']), mlhdlc_temp_dir);
Simulate the Design
Simulate the design with the test bench prior to code generation to make sure there are no runtime errors.
mlhdlc_sobel_tb
Create a New HDL Coder™ Project
Run the following command to create a new project.
coder -hdlcoder -new mlhdlc_ram
Next, add the file 'mlhdlc_sobel.m' to the project as the MATLAB function, and 'mlhdlc_sobel_tb.m' as the MATLAB test bench.
You can refer to Getting Started with MATLAB to HDL Workflow tutorial for a more complete tutorial on creating and populating MATLAB HDL Coder projects.
Turn On the RAM Mapping Optimization
Launch the Workflow Advisor.
The checkbox 'Map persistent array variables to RAMs' needs to be turned on to map persistent variables to block RAMs in the generated code.
Run Fixed-Point Conversion and HDL Code Generation
In the Workflow Advisor, right-click the 'Code Generation' step. Choose the option 'Run to selected task' to run all the steps from the beginning through HDL code generation.
Examine the Generated Code
Examine the messages in the log window to see the RAM files generated along with the design.
A warning message appears for each persistent matrix variable not mapped to RAM.
Examine the Resource Report
Take a look at the generated resource report, which shows the number of RAMs inferred, by following the 'Resource Utilization report...' link in the generated code window.
Additional Notes on RAM Mapping
- Persistent matrix variable accesses must be in unconditional regions, i.e., outside any if-else, switch case, or for-loop code.
- MATLAB functions can have any number of RAM matrices.
- All matrix variables in MATLAB that are declared persistent and meet the threshold criteria get mapped to RAMs.
- A warning is shown when a persistent matrix does not get mapped to RAM.
- Read-dependent write data cycles are not allowed: you cannot compute the write data as a function of the data read from the matrix.
- Persistent matrices cannot be copied as a whole or accessed as a sub matrix: matrix access (read/write) is allowed only on single elements of the matrix.
- Mapping persistent matrices with non-zero initial values to RAMs is not_sobel']; clear mex; cd (mlhdlc_demo_dir); rmdir(mlhdlc_temp_dir, 's');I don’t regularly read a lot of hard news or many international news sources, and I don’t read many highly specialized websites, except for some economists. My daily read usually covers what has been called the “Wonkosphere,: i.e., the generalist-oriented policy analyst types who cover developments in U.S. politics and public policy. I read a whole lot of these, scores or more different ones, in a given week. But here are some of the best, IMO.
First, see this old post I wrote, “What to read about politics and public affairs.”
Also, this one, “Foreign Affairs-Oriented Websites” for a short a list of non-specialized ones.
And, this one, “Good sites for following economics.”
Wonkosphere:
- The Washington Monthly‘s Steve Benen.
- Think Progress, including its Wonkroom: Organized by topic.
- TPMCafe: More reporting, less commentary. A great source for news on breaking U.S. political developments.
- Ezra Klein at the Washington Post
- TAPPED. The group blog of The American Prospect magazine.
- The two Jonathans: Jonathan Chait and Jonathan Cohn at The New Republic.
More Political Science-Oriented:
- The Monkey Cage: Hard core polysci, but very, very interesting.
- A Plain Blog About Politics

Welcome to Belgium’s most prestigious awards for excellence in human capital management.
Initiated 5 years ago, this great initiative aims at honoring, every year, the companies from the private and public sector that demonstrate excellence and tangible achievements in people-centric initiatives.
More specifically, we want to detect and recognize organizations that build a strong HCM capability to create competitive advantage, optimize business processes, enable innovation, foster collaboration, improve workforce productivity, develop talents, or improve customer relationship. Particular attention is also given on how those organizations sustain this capability in the long run by addressing the internal and external factors that are critical to their organisational effectiveness.
The Corporate HR Awards are organised and processed upon a strict and transparent process, clearly-defined criteria, and upon the control of a 100% neutral and objective Jury. As such, winning a Corporate HR Award is a highly prestigious and acknowledged mark of corporate accomplishment. And because the awards are given to companies and not to individuals, they are a hallmark of excellence that is valued not just by the the HR department, but also by the Board, employees, clients, partners, suppliers, and any other stakeholders. In addition, they represent an extraordinary trigger for corporate reputation, employer branding and talent attractiveness.
Award winners will be revealed and celebrated during a gala ceremony on 16 November 2017, together with the yearly HR Excellence Awards evening and in presence of 700 HCM leaders.
We look forward to welcoming you there!

Thursday, November 29, 2001 - our network provider was experiencing router problems this morning between 9:30am and 11:30am. On their behalf, sorry for any problems.
Thursday, October 11, 2001 - server move is almost done. My apologies to anyone who suffered any problems during the move - DSL was especially problematic for the last week, so redirections to the new server weren't even working.
Friday, October 5, 2001 - anyone processing e-mail got an error message from 6:30pm yesterday until 2:15pm. Cause: switching servers, forgot to register e-mail dll on the back-up server.
Saturday, September 15, 2001 - server was down from 3:30pm until 5:40pm. Cause: DSL modem would not synchronize with ISP; possible interference with other components. I am in the process of moving my server into a "real" server room, so these DSL problems will (hopefully) soon be a thing of the past.
Wednesday, August 29, 2001 - server was down from 10:00am until 10:40am. Cause: similar to previous item - rebooting router/firewall allowed reconnection.
Friday, August 10, 2001 - server was down from 5:30pm until 8:20pm. Cause: currently unresolved - server was functioning locally; possibly router, firewall, DSL modem or Bell/Nexxia network. I will be monitoring my hardware components a little closer until I track it down.
Thursday, July 19, 2001 - server was down from 5:30am until 6:40am. Cause: local Hydro transformer failure.
Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - another memory upgrade for primary server (that's 512MB in case you're counting); CPU fan cleaning; backup server performed admirably all the while
Saturday, May 26, 2001 - memory upgrade
Saturday, May 12, 2001 - server was down from 3:15pm until 5:30pm. Cause: power failure (UPS is on my list of things to get)
Wednesday, April 25, 2001 - Sometime in the future, I will look back to early 2001 and say to myself 'Ah, the good old days when there were hardly any problems...' . Since I've installed the hardware router/firewall, the server has required much less rebooting. Of course, the ADSL portion of the network still goes down once in while, but thanks to auto-reconnect, it doesn't take my server with it!
Tuesday, April 24, 2001 - server was down from 6:20pm until 6:40pm. Cause: OS instability AKA the blue screen of death
Sunday, March 18, 2001 - server was down from 5:00pm until 6:30pm. Cause: OS instability AKA the blue screen of death
Friday, February 16, 2001 - server was down from 8:50pm until 9:30pm. Cause: Router / firewall upgrade (this time - it worked!)
Friday, February 9, 2001 - server was down from 6:15pm until 7:30pm. Cause: Router / firewall upgrade
Tuesday, January 16, 2001 - server was down from 6:28am until 1:43pm. Cause: Connection software just "went away"
Thursday, December 28, 2000 - server was down from 6:28pm until 8:42pm. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network outage.
Friday, December 22, 2000 - server was down from 4:15am until 11:09am. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network outage.
Saturday, December 9, 2000 - LOTS MORE PROBLEMS! server was down from 3:15am until 7:35pm. Cause: Me! It was ALL MY FAULT. I can't blame this on anyone else this time. E-mail me if you want all the techy details, but otherwise let's just say it's a very busy time of year; it took me three trips to the server room to get it right!
Wednesday, December 6, 2000 - LOTS O' PROBLEMS! server was down from ?:??am until 1:18pm and 4:30pm until 6:55pm and then 7:??pm until 9:35pm. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network problems. My ISP claims that the problem will be solved today..!
Wednesday, November 29, 2000 - server was down from 1:58pm until 5:32pm. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network outage.
Wednesday, November 22, 2000 - server was down from about 9:15pm last night until 12:35pm. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network outage - I'm at home sick but I came into town anyway to reboot. My next server WILL be at my house in Chelsea, or on a more reliable connection...
Wednesday, November 15, 2000 - server was down from about 7:15pm until 7:45pm. Reason: memory upgrade
Friday, November 10, 2000 - Speak of the devil - server went down from 3:00am until 12:45pm. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network outage - had to come over to the server room on my lunch hour to reboot.
Thursday, November 9, 2000 - Say the good with the bad - Everything has been working beautifully for a week and a half!! No network problems, no mysterious dropped connections. I can relax and get back to my original tasks - software!
Sunday, October 29, 2000 - server was down from sometime after 7:25pm until 9:28pm. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network outage - manual reconnection required.
Tuesday, October 24, 2000 - well, I think a webmaster's diary is a good idea - I hope I have time to maintain it. The High Speed network was down from 7:41pm and about 9:15pm tonight. There have been ALOT of outages (or is it spelled 'outtages'?) recently. Usually, it used to be about once a week, but recently it's been 3 or 4...my apologies. My Highspeed ISP claims that it's a Bell/Nexxia/Redback problem; if things don't improve, I'll have to upgrade to Cable!

The flexible functionality of our modules provides complicated, yet easy-to-use, solution that supports planning, implementation, control, and analysis in all phases of the manufacturing process.
As a manufacturer, arming yourself with accurate and up-to-date information about your warehouse; production capacity; actual and desirable performance levels; resource availability and utilization; as well as targeted productivity and quality is a surefire way to excellence.
We Answer Your Essential Questions
Do I have the resources required for the coming production order?
Manage your warehouse stock and identify your production capacity. Review your bill of materials (BOM), then check the availability of raw materials stored in your warehouse or scheduled to be received. The Manufacturing Suite will also alert you to any shortage of materials that are required for your new production order.
When can I deliver the products to my customer?
Take informed production planning decisions and satisfy your customers with an accurate promise date. Before you start planning for new orders ,along with other multiple orders being processed, draw a number of what-if manufacturing scenarios that integrate information on raw materials and production lines availability. Experiment; change your parameters; and apply the approved scenario data to issue an accurate promise date to your customer.
How can I overcome resources waste?
Ensure full utilization of your resources according to your warehouse status, production plans, and promise dates. The Manufacturing Suite guides you to efficiently employ the available resources and calculates the right time for raw material purchase.

End Coordinates:
Same as starting coordinates
Car Shuttle Req'd:
No
Parking Directions:
Take Highway 80 to the Yuba Gap exit from the freeway. Turn right (south,) and in just over 2/10 of a mile turn right toward the campground. 1.1 miles further on, turn left onto forest road 19, which is unpaved. A sign at this junction points to Sky Mountain Camp if you were to go straight. You will drive along the eastern shore of Lake Valley Reservoir for a few miles, and after 4 miles turn left on road 38. A mile and a half past this point is privately owned Huysink Lake, which you will pass, and then 1/2 a mile past this is the parking area where the road bends sharply to the right. There are spots here for 5-6 cars on the left and 1-2 on the right.
Hazards of Note:
The first mile toward Salmon Lake is intermittently dusty and dirty.
Crowd Factor:
Negligible on the Salmon Lake trail until you hit Lower Loch Leven Lake. Then the crowd factor will be high, with many people visiting this area from the main trailhead near Big Bend (the next exit east of Yuba Gap.)
General Notes:
From the parking at the trailhead, you will find the old trailhead signed just to the northwest of the bend in the road. Follow this trail past an unnamed lake about 1/2 a mile in on the left, and then look sharply for a sign pointing back to your car that indicates a mile to go back that way. An obvious trail heads south, which will allow you to reach Salmon Lake within about 3/10 of a mile. Head back and pick up the original Salmon Lake trail, and then when you reach Lower Loch Leven Lake you will turn right toward Middle Loch Leven Lake. Most people come in from the trail on the left at this junction.
The trail loops around the south end of Middle Loch Leven Lake, and then heads upward toward High Loch Leven Lake at the end of the trail this direction.
Trailhead signs that are so old that the trees have started to grow back around them.
The first (unnamed) lake that you pass on your left. It is already showing signs of eventually becoming a meadow.
Salmon Lake is just about 3/10 of a mile off the main trail. While it boasts no salmon, it is filled with minature catfish which were originally placed here by Chinese railroad workers for additional sustenance.

The regional meteorology centre in Bhubaneswar said, the only other place to have dipped below five degrees was Phulbani which stood at 4.6 degree Celsius.
Bhubaneshwar: Most parts of Odisha have come under the grip of intense cold wave with the mercury plummeting to 4 degree celsius on Tuesday at Daringbadi in Kandhamal district, making it the coldest place in the state.
The regional meteorology centre in Bhubaneswar said, the only other place to have dipped below five degrees was Phulbani which stood at 4.6 degree Celsius.
Temperatures at as many as 10 towns of the state were recorded below 10 degrees Celsius.
Reports of fish and birds being found dead due to intense cold were received from different parts, particularly from the high-altitude areas of the region.
The local meteorology office said, the cold wave conditions will continue for the next 48 hours and Daringibadi is expected to receive light snowfall.
Meanwhile, the intense cold wave sweeping the hills and valleys of Himachal Pradesh continued unabated.
The mercury stayed below normal and hovered at freezing point at many places.
The high altitude tribal areas are reeling under biting cold wave conditions with minimum temperatures staying between minus eight to minus 15 degrees.
The local met office has forecast dry weather till Sunday with marginal fluctuation in temperature.
The continued dry spell is causing anxiety to farmers as rain deficit from October to December was recorded about 93 percent with most of the districts recording deficit over 90 percent.
This deficit is about 99 percent in tribal district of Lahaul-Spiti and Hamirpur district.Kullu, Kangra and Kinnaur districts recorded rain deficit in between 91 to 97 percent while it is 82 to 88 percent in remaining five districts of the state.
This dry spell has also disappointed the tourists at different tourist`s spots as there is no white snow blanket on hills.About

This course will be a simultaneous introduction to both tropical and logarithmic moduli theory, with a focus on the moduli spaces of tropical curves and logarithmic curves.
(1) Tropical and non-Archimedean geometry The first part will be an introduction to tropical geometry and its connections to non-Archimedean geometry. Topics to be discussed are Berkovich analytic spaces, the process of tropicalization for subvarieties of algebraic tori and toric varieties, and the principle of faithful tropicalization.
(2) Introduction to tropical moduli spaces This will be an elementary introduction to tropical moduli spaces with many pictures and explicit examples. In particular, I will illustrate the connection between the boundary structure of the moduli space of stable algebraic curves and the moduli space of stable tropical curves via its non-Archimedean skeleton.
(3) The moduli stack of tropical curves In this part, I am going to give an introduction to the theory of stacks with a focus on combinatorial examples. In particular, I intend to give a full construction of the moduli stack of tropical curves and to discuss how it generalizes the set-theoretic moduli space discussed in Part (2).
(4) The moduli space of logarithmic curves and its tropicalization This final part starts with an introduction to logarithmic geometry and its applications to moduli theory, leading up to the construction of the moduli space of logarithmic curves. From there, we can describe the process of tropicalization as a natural smooth and surjective tropicalization morphism over the category of logarithmic schemes (thereby solving the realizability problem for abstract tropical curves).Just purchased the new NFC ceramic ring

As the property market remains unstable, investors are turning their backs on the property ladder in favour of other investment options.
In fact, as the UK continues to navigate through the recession, latest research from the Scottish Widows Savings and Investment Report has revealed that investors are turning to the relative safety of cash as 42 per cent of investors say they have chosen a cash ISA as a long term investment this year.
In comparison, just eight per cent of those investing for the long term said that they chose property as their investment choice.
Commenting, Anne Young, savings expert at Scottish Widows said: "Nobody can predict what will happen in the property market. However, savers should be cautious about relying on the returns from their property as a long term investment."
Adding: "It is good news that more people are choosing ISAs as their investment vehicle this year."
Despite the fact that few long term investors have chosen property as their vehicle of choice, the study also found that 48 per cent of investors still have faith in property as a good investment.
Ms Young adds: "There is a real need for a shift in the strong sentiment in favour of property and for people to be educated to put money aside for their future, especially if they don't currently understand how to do it or think they can't afford it."

The beautiful country of Switzerland beckoned Mr.Rao for four consecutive years where he let his creations rule his puppet making.With a successful collaboration with Jean Bindschedler from the the Swiss Puppet museum Mr.Rao built a multipurpose puppet theatre there. In consecutive years he made giant puppets around 12 feet high for the museums 25th year anniversary.
Ranganatha Rao has always been the pioneer in any experiments related to puppetry. In 1994 he spent considerable time with Dr.Nage Gowda at his folkland Janapada Loka discussing various methods of popularising the rich heritage of Karnataka as well as promote puppetry at the Janapada loka. Dr. Nage Gowda was gracious to provide an opportunity to setup a permanent Puppet theatre at the Janapada Loka. That brought creativity at its best when Rao devised a structure that is suited for all forms of puppet shows (rod/string puppets,glove puppets,leather puppets). Rao also manufactured different masks through Janapada Loka to uphold the folk tradition that Karnataka possesses.The time spent at the Janapada Loka was invaluable in terms of generating new and various ideas of making puppets that can be cost effective/eco-friendly and quick to manufacture.The (see: – Approval of Zimbabwe gem sales will fund Mugabe, politician warns and – Process Lets Zimbabwe Off The Hook, Again). We are not surprised that people are now talking of violent resistance.
The EU’s foreign affairs chief, the British mediocrity Baroness Ashton, lauding the Kimberley Process agreement, spoke of monitoring and transparency. What delusion! ( – Statement by EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, on the agreement reached in Kimberley Process regarding Marange diamonds).
The less deluded Zimbabwe Mines Minister Obert Mpofu jubilantly declared that Zimbabwe would ‘unleash her worthiness’ on the unsuspecting world. He elaborated on this: Zimbabwe will uphold KP standards ‘in a way that has never been seen before’. Quite! (see: – Kimberley Process Clears Zimbabwe Diamonds for Export; US Chairmanship Mooted).
Mr Mpofu’s protestations somehow minded us of the man from Zvishavane who took a young lady home from the bar only to find she had turned into a donkey by the next morning. (Zimbabwean man claims prostitute turned to donkey –).
‘I find I am now in love with the donkey’ he told a court – echoing the breathless new British Ambassador Deborah Bronnert the morning after a 90 minute assignation with Mugabe (see: UK envoy speaks on Mugabe charm, Tsvangirai intelligence –). ‘Such a courteous gentleman. Friendly and engaging.’ Ms Bronnert could hardly restrain herself from gushing ‘we must drop these illegal sanctions preventing Gushongo from investing his hard-earned $3 billion in Switzerland (Mugabe Family planned to open Bank Accounts in Switzerland –).
The Vigil believes that Ms Bronnert could have delivered a more pertinent message: UK taxpayers – that includes us at the Vigil – have given you $130 million this year to make up for the billion dollars plus that you have been stealing from Marange and we insist that you honour your obligations under the GPA.
If Ms Bronnert’s new romance is difficult to take on board, how about the Zimbabwe Reserve Bank Governor talking about his true love – chickens. Not just ordinary chickens but Lunar chickens! It turns out from an interview with Business Digest that Gono is not only a Lunartic visionary but has some real qualifications – in ‘chickenomics’ (see: RBZ Governor speaks on business empire –).

Another case to which we drew attention involved ROHR activist Lovemore Muzadzi. An attempt to deport him on Monday resulted in the pilot refusing to fly and Lovemore was taken off the plane.· The Vigil has received a reply to our open letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury about his visit to Zimbabwe (see: for full text of both letters). The Archbishop expresses his ‘deep and sincere gratitude’ for our support. The reply says the Archbishop thanks the Vigil for its ‘continuing dedication’ and that he is following assiduously the situation in Zimbabwe.· We were joined by about 100 uniformed members of the Chinese spiritual organisation, the Falun Gong, whose demonstrations against communist oppression we have supported. The group included a large musical ensemble drawn from several countries. We discussed with them our disquiet at Chinese involvement in the Marange diamond racket and other matters such as arms sales to Mugabe.· Vigil management team member Luka Phiri has been invited to be a keynote speaker at the STAR (Student Action for Refugees) Conference: Freedom from Torture, 111 Isledon Road, London N7 7JW on Saturday 19th November. · Thanks to Marbel Matewa who worked hard selling the Zimbabwean newspaper.

FOR THE RECORD: 73.(Demarcus Ware photo courtesy of Denver Broncos)
By Clark Judge
Talk of Fame Network
There was a reason Cam Newton pouted after losing Super Bowl 50. He’d been beaten … and not just on the scoreboard.
Newton and his teammates were bullied by an aggressive, physical and relentless Denver Broncos’ defense that crushed him, hurt him, frustrated him and intimidated him. It roughed up his receivers, too, forcing them to drop passes — and, in the end, forced Cam and the Panthers to surrender.
Result: Another triumph of DOA … Defense Over Altitude … and what we’re left to ask is this: Was that the best defensive performance in recent Super Bowl history? Our Rick Gosselin thinks so, and he said as much in Monday’s Dallas Morning News (). At least, he thought it was the best since the Bears in Super Bowl XX.
But I’m not so sure.
I liked what the Giants did to unbeaten New England in Super Bowl XLII … and what Tampa Bay did to Oakland in Super Bowl XXXVII … and I especially liked what Seattle did to Denver two years ago. They’re among the contenders for the best Super Bowl performance by a defense in the last three decades, and the polls are open, people.
You make the choice:
SUPER BOWL XLVIII
Seattle 43, Denver 8
In the first-ever Super Bowl in the greater New York area, the Denver Broncos were supposed to demolish the league’s No. 1-ranked offense. Reason: They had MVP Peyton Manning and the highest-scoring offense in NFL history. So, a rout was expected, and a rout was delivered. Except it was Denver that was demolished. Seattle’s “Legion of Boom” defense scored more points (9) than Denver’s offense, with game MVP Malcolm Smith returning a Manning interception for a touchdown and the Seahawks forcing an early safety. Manning was sacked only once, but he was harassed again and again, and so were his receivers – with safety Kam Chancellor setting the tone early by sand-blasting Demaryius Thomas as he crossed the middle for a short catch. The message was clear: Enter at your own risk. Denver didn’t score until Seattle had put 33 on them, and by then the party was over.
SUPER BOWL XLII
N.Y. Giants 17, New England 14
The Patriots entered as a 12-point favorite, and for good reason. They hadn’t lost in 18 games and were on the verge of making history with the league’s most prolific offense and league MVP Tom Brady, who threw for a record 50 touchdowns. After putting up 73 combined points in the season finale, the two teams managed only 10 through three quarters – with the Giants pulling one of the Super Bowl’s greatest upsets when Eli Manning found Plaxico Burress in the corner of the end zone in the last minute. But that wasn’t the story. Neither was David Tyree’s miraculous 32-yard catch with his helmet to set up that score. The Giants’ defense was, holding the Patriots to one score until just under three minutes were left. It sacked Brady five times, forced a fumble and stifled an offense that, until now, couldn’t be stopped to produce one of the greatest upsets in Super Bowl history.
SUPER BOWL XXXVII
Tampa Bay 48, Oakland 21
Like Super Bowl XLVIII, this featured the league’s No. 1-ranked offense vs. its top-ranked defense, and I don’t need to tell you what happened. Uh-huh, another mismatch. Tampa Bay intercepted league MVP Rich Gannon five times, returning three for touchdowns, and sacked him five times as the Bucs jumped to an insurmountable 34-3 lead by the second half. Critics argue this one doesn’t qualify among great defensive stands because Oakland wound up with 21 points, but, c’mon, people. The Bucs scored as many touchdowns with their defense as the Raiders did with Gannon. Nope, correction: They scored more. One of Oakland’s late touchdowns was a return of a blocked punt. The Bucs’ defense absolutely dominated, with Gannon so rattled afterward that he described his performance as “nightmarish.” I’d say that’s about right.
SUPER BOWL XXXV
Baltimore 34, N.Y. Giants 7
OK, so the Baltimore Ravens didn’t shut down a league MVP or the NFL’s highest-scoring offense. They beat Kerry Collins. But the New York Giants had just buried Minnesota, 41-0, in the conference championship game and were a three-point underdog. Then the game started, and the carnage began – with the Ravens flexing their muscles. One of the most intimidating defenses in league history paralyzed its opponent, allowing only 152 yards in offense, with five sacks and four turnovers. What’s more, all 16 of the Giants’ possessions ended with either punts or interceptions, with the exception of the last one. That ended the game, with the Giants the first team since the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII not to score an offensive TD.
5 Comments
What? What about the #1 ranked 1992 Cowboys defense? They crushed the high powered #2 ranked Bills offense after going through the #1 49ers and #7 ranked Eagles’ offenses. The Bills were in the middle of their unequaled 4 consecutive AFC championships run. In the Super Bowl Dallas won 52-17, setting the record for most turnovers forced with 9, knocked one HoF QB out with a violent sack and sacked the backup (who was also good and had led the Bill’s historic comeback against Houston a few weeks earlier) multiple times too. Both QBs were harassed, hurried, and hit all day, and the Cowboys caught 4 interceptions.
HoF RB Thurman Thomas (who had averaged 92.9 yards/game that year) was shut down and held to 19 yards, getting outgained by Troy Aikman.
The only legitimate Bills offensive TD came after a blocked punt set them up near the goal line, and was more on the special teams. In the late third quarter Bills QB Frank Reich stepped over the line of scrimmage and threw a long TD pass, which was illegal back then. The NFL office would later confirm that a flag should have been thrown. The Bills were held to 10 legit points, most of them set up by a special teams play.
The Cowboys defense scored 2 touchdowns, and was millimeters away from scoring a third one if not for Lett’s premature celebration. Plus there was that signature sequence where Dallas successfully made a goal line stand.
The Cowboys had annihilated a good Eagles team in the playoffs, sacking the mobile Randall Cunningham 5 times and not giving up a garbage time TD until the game was 34-3, making the final 34-10. They beat a 49ers team on the road when San Francisco had one of the most talented offenses in NFL history, sacking Steve Young 3 times and intercepting him twice.
Overall the 1992 Cowboys had an historically great defense that only allowed 245.7 yards/game that year, the fifth lowest yearly mark of all NFL teams since 1979 (and lower than the 1985 Bears and 2000 Ravens, btw, though I’m not arguing the unit was quite as dominant as those two were; the 70s Doomsday defense was better though). They don’t get the credit they deserve, in part because they were overshadowed by a versatile, unstoppable offense that ranks as one of the greatest of all time. It took both units to accomplish the unprecedented feat of winning 3 SBs in 4 years in the Great Team Era.
As for this Super Bowl, it featured two historically average offenses that ranked mid pack this year and two really good defenses, the Broncos’ defense possibly being borderline great. Carolina was a little better on offense and the Broncos were a little better on defense. The game largely played out like I thought it would in terms of being a low scoring affair. The Broncos defense had an outstanding game and it was fun to watch them play, but I don’t think it was as good as Seattle’s win a few years ago, let alone the best of the past 30 years. BTW, Cam Newton had a good year but shouldn’t have received the MVP. I have a hard time giving that award to the QB of a defense carried team in the Parity Era.
Ah, Rasputin. Hate to break the news to you but one of those “historically average offenses” scored 500 points this season.
I hate to break it to you, Ron, but that offense ranked 11th this year. And the TEAM scored 500 points, but that’s aided by defense and special teams, and that once eye popping number doesn’t mean as much as it used to due to the massive stat inflation of this era. Yardage figures are used to rank “total” defense and offense because they better isolate the unit than points do.
The bottom line is that Carolina’s offense wasn’t even in the top 10 this year in total offense.
I hate hate hate to agree with Rasputin, because I’m a Bills fan who watched every minute of that debacle but he’s right. That D was fantastic. It had, among others, Russell Maryland, Charles Haley, Ken Norton, Leon Lett, Bill Bates (as an aging reserve), Darren Woodson and Jim Jeffcoat. Back when Wannstedt had a clue, he sent out waves of DL in rotation to increase the speed of the line, while keeping it fresh frustrating Kelly immeasurably. I hate to give the Cowboys any credit whatsoever, mostly out of jealousy-based respect, but they were great. The Bills ran 50.5% of the time, on average between 1988-1994 (aka the GLory Years). Yes, Kelly is a Hall of Famer, but the Bills were, especially in December, a run-first team. To give you an idea: THe bills rushed 29 times, but for only 108 yards, an average of just over 3. They threw 38 times, but were sacked 4 times, pressured a lot of others, and only got 254 Net yards on those passes, a bit north of 6 ypa. The Cowboys absolutely deserve to be in that conversation, and it is killing me to say it. (All stats courtesy:)Why did the New York Times run the article at this time? Was it pitched by Forest City Ratner, as Brooklyn Daily Eagle columnist Dennis Holt suggested was likely?
It was time for the Times to do an update. (Front page of national edition at right.) After all, it was more than six months after architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff was predicting a redesign for Phase One of the project. Crain's New York Business was predicting the project had only a 50% chance.
The Times had not covered various "smaller" news stories about the project, including the decision, announced at the end of February, that the appeal in the case challenging the environmental review would not be heard until September, despite requests by Forest City Ratner and the Empire State Development Corporation that it be heard in May.
Did Forest City Ratner use the Times as much as it has previously?
On the other hand, FCR couldn't have been happy that reporter Charles Bagli knew that the developer was cold-calling potential office tenants to gin up interest in the speculative Miss Brooklyn office tower. The developer's circulation of a letter signed by Frank Gehry was, WNYC (and former New York Observer) reporter Matthew Schuerman said on All Things Considered yesterday, "a rare and desperate move." Bagli's discovery probably provided leverage to get a rare interview with Bruce Ratner.
Is the arena on track, as the Times suggested in a headline? Will it open in 2010?
On this issue, the developer was met with insufficient skepticism. As I commented on the New York Times's CityRoom blog, the Nets arena may be the developer’s current priority but it is not necessarily on track. It may be “said to be on track.” So a more precise headline would have read “NETS ARENA IS ‘ON TRACK.’”
However, the arena can’t be built until lawsuits are cleared and/or the state condemns needed property. Also, given the history of misleading claims–the developer originally said the arena would open in 2009, but now says 2010–any current timetable claim should be taken with a major grain of salt. The three-year bridge reconstruction clock points to 2011 as a likely best-case scenario.
What about the 50% prediction by Crain's?
As I wrote on Wednesday, the project has a much less than 50% chance of being built as proposed, and in the announced ten-year timetable. However, the Atlantic Yards arena does indeed have a greater than 50% chance of being built. The project, as others have pointed out in the past day, is hardly dead, just delayed, perhaps for a very long time.
What's up with the New York Times giving the developer and its allies the last word in major articles about Atlantic Yards?
In this article, the closing line was “This is a good project,” he said of Atlantic Yards. “Good things sometimes take a long time.” The infamous 10/14/05 "modern blueprint" article ended with a self-serving quote from Ratner flack Joe DePlasco. The 11/6/05 Routine Changes, or 'Bait and Switch'? article ended with a quote from ACORN's Bertha Lewis. An intermittently skeptical 7/5/06 article on blight nevertheless ended with a quote from the Empire State Development Corporation.
Weak journalism? Fair assessment? Some extra help for FCR, the business partner of the parent New York Times Company? I don't know, but I'll stand by my contention that, given the business relationship between the developer and the Times Company, the news coverage should be exacting, and it's not.
How long might this project take?
Nobody knows. “It’s not going to happen in a nanosecond,” Bruce Ratner told the Times in a masterpiece of understatement. (Remember, when the project was announced in December 2003, the arena was supposed to be up and running by 2006. Here's DDDB's comment about multiple promises.) Remember, Chuck Ratner of parent Forest City Enterprises said last year, “We are terrible, and we’ve been a developer for 50 years, on these big multi-use, public private urban developments, to be able to predict when it will go from idea to reality."
Project landscape architect Laurie Olin said it could take 20 years. That might be a working baseline.
Did Forest City Ratner know what it was doing in its AY plans? How much was it hurt by the credit crunch?
Well, there's significant evidence that the announced plan for 2 million square feet of office space (and thus 10,000 jobs) was overpromised from the start, and that some condos were planned from the start. Officials should have recognized that. The switch of most office space to condos was dictated by both the market and, apparently, an effort to gain Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's support and not compete with a rebuilding Lower Manhattan.
But FCR couldn't have predicted the downturn in the condo market.
Should the Empire State Development Corporation in December 2006 have approved a project with its announced ten-year timeline, expected to be concluded in 2016?
Given that the timeline was already out of date, no. (Much more from DDDB here.) A state judge, however, didn't think that was a legitimate reason to challenge the environmental review. An appellate court will get another chance to weigh in.
Yes, and it also reminds us that the 9/5/06 lead article (headline at right) predicting a six to eight percent cut in the size of the project was way overplayed.
Was "the promise" affordable housing, now "on the back burner, while the arena has been moved to the front burner," as Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn's Daniel Goldstein told the New York Times?
Well, the arena was always the developer's priority, given the urgency of moving the money-losing Nets from New Jersey, and the towers around the arena couldn't be built without the arena first.
But the political support for the project derived significantly from the affordable housing, and the larger the gap between arena and housing, the more supporters should take a second look.
What about Brooklyn Daily Eagle columnist Dennis Holt's statement that "the arena was always on the front burner -- everything else revolved around it. Its construction, along with the associated buildings around it, would make possible much of the affordable housing planned for the project elsewhere."
Well, from the perspective strictly of architecture, the arena would make possible the affordable housing. However, without sufficient bonding capacity, the affordable housing can't be built, so an extant arena wouldn't be enough.
No. That money is for a separate Forest City Ratner project, 80 DeKalb Avenue.
Should the credit crunch and the slowing economy be blamed for the stall in the project, as Borough President Marty Markowitz and ACORN have suggested?
Only partially. A significant component is the longer-standing limit of a too-small pool of affordable housing bonds.
How long until the confidence that Markowitz and ACORN have in Forest City Ratner seems misplaced?
Good question. After all, the public subsidies and spending going into this project might have paid off with a significant slice of affordable housing a lot sooner had they been directed elsewhere and/or toward a different or modified project at and/or around the Vanderbilt Yard. Right now, ACORN and Markowitz are showing loyalty. ACORN, for example, hasn't criticized the developer despite a retreat from the 50/50 pledge.
At a certain point, their position becomes less tenable. Let's see what other affordable housing supporters, like Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries and City Council Member Bill de Blasio (a candidate for Borough President) have to say.
When did the lack of bonding capacity for affordable housing become clear?
In early 2007.
Was that constraint obvious in late 2006 when the project was approved?
No, but that's partly because city and state officials were unwilling to reveal the subsidies required for the housing component of the project. It deserved a lot more scrutiny.
Was it reasonable to expect the benefits from the Community Benefits Agreement when it was signed in 2005? Does the CBA offer sufficient guarantees?
"Unfortunately, the CBA doesn't give the community any real redress," writes CBA expert Amy Lavine. Ratner, she suggests, "also probably can't be blamed for misrepresenting the terms of the contract, since the prospects for the development looked a lot better in 2005."
Yes, but it's still worth looking back at whether expectations for affordable housing bonds were reasonable at the time.
Could elected officials propose more subsidies for the project?
Quite likely. Forest City Ratner can make the case that conditions have changed, and subsidies are required for the public benefit. And if officials think something is better than nothing, they might pony up. The counter-argument is that Forest City Ratner should not be rewarded for proposing something that wasn't tenable in the first place.
Look for a proposal for subsidies with some sort of compromise attached to it. A commenter on Brownstoner suggested, "As it is, he'll be back to the city and state for more subsidies for the arena in exchange for giving up ownership or part of it, and the arena will be a public auditorium for which the use of eminent domain is not controversial."
Actually, the arena would be publicly-owned (but "generously leased" for $1, as a federal appellate court acknowledged), so some other deal might be in the works. Could the state have any leverage to get a piece of the arena's enormous upside: the $400 million Barclays Capital naming rights deal, as well as all the other sponsorships that Forest City Ratner would reap?
Will the Nets move to Newark in the short or long term?
To move from the money-losing Izod Center in the Meadowlands to the new Prudential Center in Newark would require the Nets to pay a significant penalty ($12 million.).If New Jersey officials want to sweeten the pot, they could renegotiate that penalty. Even with the penalty, the increased potential revenues--from more seats sold and a share of the suite revenue--certainly provide an argument to move to Newark in the interim. [Updated 3/24] Neil deMause calls the penalty "chump change;" still, the suites at the Atlantic Yards arena would be very lucrative.
The longer the Brooklyn arena is delayed, the stronger the argument for a short-term Newark move. Surely Forest City Ratner has plugged the numbers in a spreadsheet. (Updated: A commenter on NetsDaily suggests that it's more likely the team will go up for sale.)
Does Forest City Ratner have a "successful track record of development through all economic climates," as Markowitz suggested?
Yes, but that basically means waiting for the developer to decide when and if to commit (and borrow and get government-subsidized) funds and resources.
How much blight might there be?
The prediction that "interim surface parking" on the Ward Bakery site could last for decades is becoming more credible. And empty lots, rather than buildings, bordering the arena are hardly what Frank Gehry had in mind.
Should the litigation challenging the project also be blamed? Did DDDB try to kill the project by stalling? Are the lawsuits "frivolous," as the Eagle's Dennis Holt suggested?
The litigation deserves some but hardly all blame (or credit, depending on your perspective). DDDB has tried a variety of tactics to kill the project because it doesn't think the project's legitimate.
Well, U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert M. Levy a year ago wrote that the eminent domain case raised "serious and difficult questions regarding the exercise of eminent domain under emerging Supreme Court jurisprudence."
As for the state lawsuit challenging the environmental review, as I wrote, the judge acknowledged that, had the defendants responded to some of the plaintiffs' concerns, it might have been better public policy, but that the court's role in reviewing such decisions was limited. Maybe some think that's frivolous, but that's still an important acknowledgment. And that case isn't over.
Does the delay actually help Forest City Ratner?
Well, sort of. Any delay in the arena means the developer keeps losing money on the Nets. And there is a carrying cost to all this property. However, as a commentator on Brownstoner noted, "Imagine if he had started construction a year ago and finished in a collapsing market. He'd have lost a mint."
Should the Public Authorities Control Board take a second look at the project, as Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn contends, given that, when the PACB approved it 15 months ago, the arena was to cost $637.2 million, but it now would cost $950 million?
I don't know the law on this. But the change certainly is an argument for greater public scrutiny of some kind. A commenter on NetsDaily stated, "I really do not understand how a specific proposal gets approved and then Ratner can turn around and alter it without having to go through the process again. That is a betrayal of public trust."
That deserves a lot more discussion.
Does the failure to deliver the public benefits--affordable housing, blight removal, open space--mean that the eminent domain case has another shot, since a federal judge and appellate court both cited those expected benefits in their dismissals of the case?
Not necessarily. The courts only rule on what state officials at the Empire State Development Corporation might have reasonably believed. If the case goes to trial, the plaintiffs will have to prove that the ESDC's belief was unreasonable. There is an argument for that, but that requires looking at the ESDC's due diligence in assessing the benefits claimed at the time, not the ESDC's capacity to predict the changing market. For example, the ESDC predicted new tax revenues without weighing many public costs and subsidies. Should the ESDC have known that funding for affordable housing was questionable? Quite possibly.
Will architect Frank Gehry walk away from the project, as New York Times architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff has proposed?
Well, it's quite likely that Gehry has already walked away from most of the project, given that all but the arena is on hold. And, given that the man is getting on in years, it was unreasonable to expect him to work on the whole project, as required by Forest City Ratner, at least in its public statements.
However, even though Atlantic Yards wouldn't provide Gehry a chance to "build a whole neighborhood practically from scratch," it still must be tempting for him to build his first arena. Perhaps the question is whether he can retain any component of his original vision of the arena wrapped in towers.
Are Atlantic Yards foes really "stickin' it to the lil' guys," as Daily News columnist Errol Louis wrote February 7, referencing the opponents request for sufficient time to prepare their appeal in the state lawsuit?
At that point, Louis was suggesting that "100 employees at the site, mostly laborers, could be in trouble," but "There's no danger of a full halt right now."
Well, the latter remains true, but all the "lil' guys" expecting work on a major project have a lot more waiting to do. In other words, the credit crunch, as well as the longstanding limit on affordable housing funds, are to blame as well as any litigation.
If the project was once to cost $4 billion, but the arena cost has gone up 50% (as I was the first to point out, given the Times's lack of context), what's the new price tag?
We don't know. The New York Post, in its follow-up story today, noted "The developer's firm declined to estimate what the entire project will now cost."
Does the New York Post like giving credit to other publications?
No. Today's story cites only a "published report" rather than acknowledge a front-page story in the Times. Then again, the Daily News didn't even cover the story today.
The former, but the colloquial usage, as the headline in the Times's CityRoom at right suggests, favors the developer. Gothamist described "plans to build a Nets arena at the Atlantic Yards." New York Times columnist Clyde Haberman yesterday described "developers with eyes on... the Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn."
However, as I wrote when describing how AY was used to describe the railyard, "They falsely conflate the developer's commercial branding--a project called Atlantic Yards--with a much smaller piece of publicly-owned land." Similarly, Atlantic Yards is a site or a project, not a place.
Should BrooklynSpeaks be pursuing a proposal for a new governance entity?
Well, if Atlantic Yards goes forward, there's certainly an argument for a governance entity. But BrooklynSpeaks, as well as local elected officials, might be more productive in the short term just getting some clear answers about the project. And they might start focusing on some interim uses for the inevitable vacant lots.
Was the resignation of ESDC Downstate Chairman Patrick Foye connected to Atlantic Yards, as a commenter suggests?
Unlikely. Foye was a friend of departing Governor Eliot Spitzer, as the Times reported, and his resignation was more likely connected to that personal tie. Avi Schick, acting chief executive, sure seems to be an Atlantic Yards supporter.
Is this project being "built on the come" (a poker term) and the ESDC sponsored a marketing scheme, as a commenter suggests?
There's certainly evidence for that. If Miss Brooklyn, which always was to contain office space, wouldn't be built without an anchor tenant, and if the market for office space in Downtown Brooklyn had been tanking for years, shouldn't the ESDC have evaluated that?
Is it a coincidence that ESDC head Foye resigned days before the revelations? I think not. He knew it was coming, told Patterson, and the new governor showed him the door. Seems to me that using eminent domain for a project that is so speculative - e.g. requiring an anchor tenant as a prerequisite to building Miss Brooklyn - but telling no one, is malfeasance. Every piece of AYP litigation could and should be reopened in light of these revelations. The arena will never be built because Atlantic Yards now has as many friends in high places as did our former governor Spitzer after his fateful news conference.
this AYP collapse seems less related to the immediate credit crunch than the fact that the entire project was to be built on the come, ESDC knew it, and thus sponsored not a bricks and mortar project, which is the intent of the UDC Act, but rather a marketing scheme - how can such a speculative and uncertain business plan be treated as a legitimate public purpose so as to justify use of eminent domain?
watch - this will get litigated
Why does Markowitz still think we should build an arena in the most inappropriate location possible if there's no affordable housing attached?
Wasn't that the pretense he used to support the whole overblown project? What is his pretense now?
first of all I want to congratulate you on the best summary of the current state of AY that I have seen.
People seem to forget that this is an approved ESDC project and pulling the approval is not only not easy its probably impossible. Litigation won't be reopened because of these changes. Courts leave this to political decisions but once a contract or agreement is made, government entities can't just end it without incurring costs unless they reserved rights to do so and no document I have seen contained such a reservation. The "deal" was signed under the previous governor before Spitzer took over(although its clear he approved of it). Brooklyn Speaks of which I participate has been trying to do what you suggest and at the same time go forward on the governance as we(as pretty much any thinking person thought) assumed there would be changes and time table modifications which someone should oversee and not just rubber stamp.
The NY Observer originally reported that Foye would stay and then came his resignation. If anything Avi Schick is closer to ex-governor Spitzer as Foye was. I am still curious of what the internal dissension that was occurring at ESDC was or is.
If the City and the State had allowed this to go through the City's ULURP procedure, which many of us suggested, the project would have been approved(in some modified format) and the building would have begun. It was Ratner himself who refused to go through that proceedure..cause he knew that he wouldn't have gotten what he wanted...

Ben, Marc’s son, has drunk from the exact same style of cup since he was two years old. Now at the age of 13, his current cup was falling apart fast.
Much to Marc’s relief and amazement, his tweet was retweeted more than 12,000 times and offers from around the world came in from people who still had the cup and were willing to send him their, despite it now being long out of stock.
Not only were strangers sending him their cups, but the manufacturer, UK based Tommee Tippee also stepped in. Although they had not produced the cup for Boots since the late 1990’s, they looked into a way of reproducing it. They took to even looking all over the world in countless factories until they found the original mould. No doubt with some relief.
To Marc’s delight, Tommee Tippee offered to reproduce a life time’s supply of the cup – 500 units in fact.
In what has proven to be a horrible, bleak year for so many, a little ray of sunshine like this is just what so many of us need.
Well done Marc for doing a wonderful thing for your son. Well done to the thousands of people who helped locate cups and well done to Tommee Tippee for doing a particularly kind, caring and decent thing.

I’ve always been a fan of the Moody Blues, but to be honest, I’ve never understood what the title of that album meant. However, I do believe it might be an apt title of this post because I have a tendency to think a lot, reflect a lot and and that usually ends up with me writing a lot of letters of apology for sins committed some 36 years after the fact. I remember contemplating what life would be like as I turned 50. And here I am, at the precipace of the half century mark and realizing it wasn’t at all how I had mentally constructed it all those decades ago.
My life is a melange of things. That’s no different than anyone else, I suppose but if you’ll induge me in this brief introspection (you only have 25 days left to ride this age focused, angst ridden storm out, Kids!!) I think of my youth and it all centers around the age of ten through mid-way 14. That was before life got so incredibly complicated and as a result, I cherish those carefree days. My past, with it being so focused on that particular era of my life, in is enrexorably connected to my life long friend, Cheryl and my sister, Karol.
And then there was the music.
AM radio was all we had back then and TV wise, we only got three channels–four if you included PBS, which we rarely did. We watched everythingl the intro, plot, conflicts–all that man versus man stuff–and we even knew the credits.
Bing Crosby Productions was at the helm of “Hogan’s Heroes”.
William Asher (who would later direct his wife, Elizabeth Montgomery in “Bewitched”) sat in a canvass chair in a beret, jodhpur, with a megaphone in hand on the set of “I Love Lucy”.
Wilbur Hatch conducted the Desi Arnaz Orchestra.
Color was by Deluxe; cinematograpy was handled by Karl Fruend and and of course, le San du Cosmetique, Max ‘By God’ Factor applied make up to the entire “Lucy” cast, including Bill Frawley…and that took some doing. You know, Willie was in the throws of abject acholohism when he co-starred in that iconic sit-com. Every once in a while, if you look down at “Fred’s” hands, you can see him battling the DTs. I’m talking real Hugh Beaumont caliber of shakes. He’d try to cover them up by placing his hands in his trouser pockets. You could still see the tremors through the pants. Well, it was either that or he was feeling cocky all day!!!!!
But I digress…
What I’m getting at is the fact that the years 1968 through the first half of 1973 are 24k gilded nemories for me. Memories keep us young and that said, I’m about to lay on you a Fountain of Youth via the written word and with video.
Karol is just under four years older than me. In The Glory Days, we used to do what the kid’s today call ‘hanging out”. As a reminder, we grew up in Small Town, Texas. We road around a lot. OPEC adored us. We’d get in Karol’s old 61 touquoise Dodge Dart, aptly named “Eunice”. We’d drive by people’s houses and honk madly. A couple of honks for a friend, multiple honks for best friends…..abject squealing and long, olfactory numbing horn blasts for boyfriends.
Although my father owned a successful Chrysler dealership, Pater always insisted that our first cars were older models. Much older models. Karol’s first horseless carriage had push button gears and a black painted metal dashboard that everyone scratched their names upon. Those unfamiliar with Eunice, or Karol or strange Kendrick ways, would get in the car and swear the car was named “Henry Gilley”.
We wore a lot of Hang Ten shirts, the early 70’s adolescent version of the Izod and inspired by the Bunch Brady.
We’d keep on, keep on, keep on wearing them all the time. Remember Hang Ten clothing with the embroidered feet?
Karol and I loved Hang Ten. We had shirts, pants; pant suits with button flies that looked like hands. We thought we were styling; real small town haute couture. We’d often don our Hang 2-Fives while watching Saturday morning cartoons.
Don’t EVEN try to lie about this, Karol! You know it’s true.
MEMORY #1
The intro to the Hardy Boys Show. Karol and I really dug the vest wearing, blond Hitler Youth lookin’ one.
♦
Neato.
This most memorable “Peter Pan Peanut Butter” commercial from 1972 features Her Majesty, Alan Suess. If you remember, he was the ascot wearing cast member on “Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-In”.
Way out, Daddy!
♦
This Christmas commercial from 1971, features bubbly. It brings back bittersweet memories for my sister and me.
Yeah….booze…hooch….firewater…sauce. Sweet Lady Liver Killer.
♦
Now, this golden moldy oldie is from 1965 and frankly, I can’t believe I found the intro on You Tube.
I was six and a big fan of the show, “Shenanigans”, a Saturday morning game show for kids. I even had the board game and all I remember is the theme song from this show and that the board game consisted of an obstacle course of sorts. It had a tiddly wink section you had win because if you didn’t you couldn’t progress , you wouldn’t win all the ‘shenanegans”, whatever those were. That part of the game was called Pie In The Sky.
“Shenanigans” was hosted by veteran star of stage and screen, a one Mr. Stubby Kaye. Picture him as a mid century Jack Black, only more Jewish.
Yowzah, man.
♦
This also goes way back and if anyone else remembers this Saturday morning show, I’ll force Karol to eat her hat. It’s “The Double Deckers”, which featured a bunch of kids in London who hung out in this old double decker bus in a lot or something. I think they solved crimes, or debated the subtext of the book, “Silas Marner” or argued the pros and cons of voting Labour vs. Conservative.
It was a politically correct show for the radical Sixties. It had a token Black child and the requisite Nerd King who was pudgy, wore glasses, smarter than everyone else, who’s play clothes consisted of britches (of an almost Fauntlerian style), a startched, button down shirt and a bow tie.
I’ll bet he hated gym class.
♦
Remember “Love American Style” where ugly old cats like Milton Berle could mug it up with 60’s B-List actresses like Rosemary DeCamp?
The Cowsills sang the intro one year and then they were replaced with the Doodle Town Pipers or some shit.
♦
I loved “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour”. This clip contains short clips and mostly vintage commercials from the late 60’s. Look carefully at the tux wearing men in the beginning. You’ll see a very young and very brunette Steve Martin along with Grammy Award winning composer Mason Williams. The big and tall hulking guy is “Super Dave Osborne”. All three were writers for the show.
Enjoy the commercials. You’ll be amazed at what the brain trusts on what Madison Avenue considered advertising in the 60’s. Signs of the times, I guess.
♦
Here’s one you’ll remember. This commercial won all kinds of awards for it’s presentation. Remember the Gulf No-Kocks gasoline commercial? Crude? Yes. Archaic looking? Indubitively. Cutting edge for it’s time? Definitely. Animators used “stop motion” photography to make it look as though Gulf gulping commuters were all butt propelled.
♦
THEE MOST obnoxious commercial ever produced:
♦
Here’s one trippy, trippy floor wax commercial:
♦
This takes me back. Animated ass and all!!!!
♦
Candy coated popcorn, peanuts and a prize:
Rest in peace, Jack Gillford.
♦
Coke….classic commercial. Dig it!
♦
Tonight, on the ABC Movie of the WEEK:
♦
We’ve Got To Get It On Again. I’ve been saying that since the summer of ’72
♦
The Addrissi Brothers also sang the intro to “Nanny and The Professor”
I cannot account for the slow speed of this version. I guess it was from the album, “The Addrissi Brothers: The Quaalude Years”.
Don’t bother listening. It made me tired.
Groovy.
♦
This one will take you back:
♦
Well kids, that’ll do it for this traipse down Memory Lane. I’ll be back later with more commercials and TV intros. And providing you kept your High School and college Ousley’s to a minimum, you might even remember some of them.
In the meantime, I’m off to commune with Morpheus. My Gerital has run it’s course and my Sominex is kicking in.
Safe and restful sleep….sleep….sleep.
.
I like it when you take trips down memory lane.
I never was a big fan of the Moody Blues. Bring on some Beatles, LK…I think I have all of their albums and some 45’s thanks to my dad owning a radio station! Remember the “remote bus” he had? They did remotes from the Town and Country days parade and then it was parked by the Crazy Red Horse! Why?
I really remember the “ring around the collar” commercial because my mom (a homemaker) would say–“that commercial degrades women–I’m never buying Wisk”–and she never did.
However, she did make sure dinner was on the table and ready when my dad walked in the door–weird.
As dysfunctional in many ways as our family was, we all sat down to supper almost every night, too. I don’t know if that was mother’s choice or if it just happened that way. We had our assigned chore-mine was put ice in the glasses and make the tea, Kathy’s was making a salad and I think Laurie’s was setting the table. But we all had to pitch in and help clean up. How we hated doing that!
Karol–I had the same family experience. My sister would purposely take double the time necessary to eat to ensure that I would get the lionshare of the cleanup duties. I also had the fun job of bringing my parents a couple of ashtrays so they could smoke after dinner. Then I get to clean those out as well. OMG–talking about this makes me think I might need therapy–I can feel the anger welling up inside me–oh no, that is just my reaction to the President telling us today that if we buy a GM car our warranty will be backed by the United States Government. ARGHH!!!!
I have several things to say-you and Karol had least had a carriage! I was on the horse!!!!My first car (if you call it that) was a tan (who would ever buy a tan car???)that also had push button controls. Ugly as sin-that’s why I kept a steady boyfriend so I wouldn’t have to drive that thing very often. Also, Karol remember what you would do when it was time to “do” the dishes????I finally got smart and would just sit there til you came back. Are you sure Laurie had a chore???????HAHAHA We won’t go into the why’s and why not’s of needing therapy. Wonder what my kids would say about their upbringing? I am sure their therapist finger would point to me. I just love going down memory lane-thanks Lar.
Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is. Even today. The show I absolutely detested was the “Newlywed Game.” The only way you could watch it was if you took a shot everytime that big-hair jerk said [gawd, I can barely stand to even type it–now it’ll be stuck in my head all day] “making whoppee.” However, the best one was when Bob asked the wife what was the strangest place they ever “made whoppee.” Just as calm as you please, she replied, “Well, that would be in the butt, Bob.”
nostalgia ain’t what it used to be…thanks for the trip, LaKendrick
I love it when you do this (so we don’t have to). I love being taken back like this to simpler times, especially when these older TV moments would probably have stayed a long lost memory.
My dearest big sister. I, too, had a push buttoned, 1963 turquoise Dodge Dart that had a monster-size steering wheel with a mind of it’s own. That car was so ugly, my boyfriend made me park it in the alley once because he didn’t want it seen sitting in front of his house! Once, cousin Kyle and I made it from Kenedy to KC in 2.35 minutes in that heep. NOTE: There’s six miles between the two towns. When Eunice went, she flew!
Some great video clips here! If I may offer a small correction: Mason Williams was indeed the head writer for “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour”; however, he does not appear in the clip you posted. The “tux wearing men” are, in order of appearance: SBCH writer Murray Roman; Bob “Super Dave Osborne” Einstein; Steve Martin, and SBCH writer Carl Gottlieb. Bob Einstein, incidentally, is the older brother of Albert Brooks (whose real name is, in fact, Albert Einstein!)
I stand corrected, CB. Thanks for the see the evil of my ways. My eyes ain’t what they used to be.
Best,
LK
Amazing post Laurie. You killed. I died from nostalgic overdose. Then I came back from the dead, but all fuzzy and in black & white. Thanks a bunch!
WOW! And I thought my recent stroll down memory lane was a minor kick–minor indeed! I remember The Smothers Brothers, and for some reason I always loved watching the Ken Berry Show although I haven’t the faintest idea why.
I remember Laugh In and Daktari, and those Tide commercials–“Ancient Chinese secret.” Remember Freakies cereal?
What a great way to feel like a kid again, if only for a few passing moments. Wonderful post!The engine is roaring, the smell of burnt petrol fills the air, the heat from the tires hits you in the face, the road stretches out in front of you. The car starts to shake, the chassis starts to twist, you grip the wheel, lick your lips, narrow your eyes. As the lights count down, you feel your breath slow down. Your pulse is starting to race, you feel the car straining at the leash, waiting to be unleashed. The green light comes on and you pop the clutch, shift into first and race for the horizon. The finish line seems so far away. You develop tunnel vision, the world zips by. The speedometer keeps climbing, it is just you and the machine working as one to go as fast as you can dare. Flames shooting out of the exhaust, your car screams across the line. That is drag racing!
The world of drag racing has long fascinated us. Ever since we were kids, we wanted to go fast, go loud and be the first. Everyone has sometime or the other, just held on to the wheel and tried to go as fast as they can, just for bragging rights. The culture of drag racing started a long time ago. On the dry lake beds of California. The world was soon captivated with this concept. The world of V6s and V8s started to rumble and shout. As the sport grew, so did the fascination. Hollywood soon caught this bug and then showcased it in various movies. The idea is simple, just hold on to the steering wheel, keep your foot down, and just beat the other guy. After the Second World War, with the war economy booming, cars were cheap to obtain and also to race. In fact, in the movie Grease’s set in the ’50s, we got to see such a race. John Travolta and his gang tune up an old beater and turn her into Greased Lightening. Because that’s how fast that car can go. You might be wondering how hard is it to go fast, anyone can do it. However you are mistaken, it takes skill, an innate knowledge of the mechanics of the car, the determination to find the ragged edge and the guts to ride it till the end. Sounds like fun, doesn’t it? Remember, kids, don’t try this at home. Or you will have a tough time explaining to your mother why her car is stuck in a tree.
As the cars evolved, so did the racing. We got to see Mustangs, Corvettes, Camaros, Dodge Charger, Pontiac GTOs, Chevelles, Plymouth Super-Birds, Hemi-Cudas and many more take to the streets and race for glory and prestige. To do the standing quarter-mile in under 10 seconds was the golden pinnacle for these racers. After that the world changed again. We got to see super-charged and turbo-charged racers come in from Japan. Nimble and with huge turbo-boosting, muscle cars had their noses put out of joint. You can see this in the movie Fast and Furious. The first one where Paul Walker goes toe-to-toe with Vin Diesel. A Toyota Supra goes head-to-head with a Dodge Charger R/T. Tires squealing, we got treated to a race that made us reach the edge-of-our-seats.
By the way, if you think that drag racing is just devoted to cars, you are sorely mistaken. Bikes too have played their part in this quest for speed and glory. Most super bikes are tuned and set for race standard. The idea is quite simple, hold the clutch, twist the throttle and hold on for dear life as the front-end lifts. This is best shown in the movie Biker Boyz. A story of biker clubs who rule street-racing. This kind of racing has come to our country. These races take place on abandoned roads far from prying eyes. A word of warning, do not for once think that you can do the same. This kind of street-racing is in fact illegal without the correct permits, licenses, protection and proper bikes or cars.
Now you might be wondering about how to take part in something like this, or even witness this glorious spectacle of worship to the Gods of speed. Easy, just come on down to The Valley Run 2014. This is where you will find hardcore racers and amateurs battle it out. Unleash your speed demons, feel the wind on your face and cross that finish line.Shelley Macon

2009-PresentNiantic, the developer of Pokemon Go game released an update for iPhone as well as Android users that bring in the new Buddy feature while at the same time preventing jailbroken or rooted devices from being able to play the game. By bringing this update, Niantic was thinking that most of the cheat apps for Pokémon Go require a rooted device and by blocking rooted users, the developer thought it would cut off cheaters.
However, the sad news for the developer, which may still be good news for the cheaters, is that the best cheat for Pokémon Go available on iPhone seems to be still working following the 1.7.0 update. The interesting thing about this is that the cheaters don’t even have to jailbreak their iPhone to use it.
One struggle for players when playing Pokemon Go game is that they have to do a lot of walking so that they catch them all. An augmented reality gameplay is provided by your actual location and camera of the phone. What this means is that a player has to dedicate a lot of time to the game, and this is something that seems annoying to players considering that tracking Pokémon does not appear to be as easy as it is intended.
Smart players have therefore devised ways to cheat and one popular cheat entails spoofing their location in order not for them to bike, walk or drive there.
It is an amazing hack that allows you to face the location you are in while also helping you to decide the Pokémon to hunt. So, you actually do it from school, work, or other location without even needing to move.
All you need to do for the cheat to work is install a fake app right on your iPhone without having to jailbreak the device.Richard Froese

A young man will spend the rest of his life behind bars after he was sentenced for murdering two teens in Whitefish Lake First Nation in July 2016.
Edward Devon Boyce Gladue, of Whitefish, was sentenced to life in prison on Nov. 6 in Court of Queen’s Bench in Peace River after he pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder in the shooting deaths of Dylan Laboucan, 17, and Cory Grey, 19,
The boyfriend and girlfriend were killed July 23, 2016, stated news reports in the Edmonton Sun and Journal on Nov. 7.
Gladue was 19 when he was arrested oh Aug. 11, 2016 in Peace River.
Laboucan’s body was discovered the evening of July 25 by a community search party.
Grey’s body was recovered the afternoon of July 26.
The teens were returning from a family gathering when Gladue showed up at the house, according to an agreed statement of facts.
Laboucan was shot in the chest, causing him to bleed to death. Grey was assaulted and asphyxiated before she was shot in the back.
The young couple was preparing to move to Slave Lake where they planned to attend Northern Lakes College. Laboucan planned to study power engineering, while Grey was going to take early childhood education.
Gladue is eligible parole after 13 years. He has also been ordered to give a DNA sample, is not allowed to own firearms or contact the families of the deceased.I recently came across a well known fashion forum in which people were asking– why are designer items priced so high? I was shocked to see some of the replies that this question received, so today we’ll take a look into why designer items are priced so high.
Designer clothes are expensive for various reasons. What we know of today as ‘haute couture’ started in the mid 19th century. Eventually it became regulated. Today there are many strict rules as to what you must do to get classified as a haute couture house such as the number of people that mare employed in your house or the amount of workrooms, etc.
What one must understand about the cost is that each couture fashion house strives to create a collection that is timeless– something that will be revered for its attention to detail and quality for decades to come. In couture only the finest luxury fabrics are used. Each house strives to maintain the integrity of the piece they designed while making adjustments to the clients figure and personal preference—which sometimes, will even double the work load.
When you buy a couture item, it is required of all haute couture houses that at least one fitting is held. This is labor-intensive process. You also must understand is that these houses sew all of their clothes by hand—only using machine where VERY uniform stitches MUST bee seen.
There are many different sections of a haute couture house. In these houses there is a tailoring room and a dress making room, each having its individual specifications as to how it carries out its work. This may vary from what they make down to the details of what thimbles they use.
Detailed work, such a beading and metal casting is often sent to one of the many specialty shops in Paris. Most everything in haute couture is custom made, including the buttons (and fabric)!
Pret-a-porter, or ready-to-wear collections are different in that the pieces in the collection are not primarily sewn by hand. Instead pieces are assembled my machine operators in a piece-work system in which each operators performs the same task over and over again; thus there is a considerable amount of less handwork than that in haute couture. Luxury ready to wear is made of out high-quality fabrics and sold to many high-end stores in the worlds—however hundreds of each item may be made, versus only the handful that may be made in haute couture. Most of these pieces are clean finished or lined with a rayon or silk lining that conceals the unfinished seams.PLAYER: Michael DiLiello
POSITION: QB
SCHOOL: Cooper City
CLASS: 2018
HEIGHT: 6-1
WEIGHT: 185
SCOUTING: There are very few football prospects in South Florida who have made more gains than this quality football player. Having followed him over the past year and watching him perform a number of times live, there was never a doubt that DiLiello was going to be a very special player. By making the playoffs last season, DiLiello had an opportunity to really showcase his skills – and opposing coaches and players were watching. At 7-on-7 tryouts and during the current offseason, he has been singled out for his play by coaches from all over the country. DiLiello will be a top 5 rated quarterback in a very talented South Florida area. Everyone is excited to see what happens in the spring.

Thank you to all the domestic goddesses who plied us with such gorgeous fare as fresh scones, rum balls, brandy pudding sweets, meringues and strawberries, quiches, delicious savoury whats’a’names, alpaca toasts, beetroot dip, xmas tree bikkies, fruit mince pies; raspberry & white chocolate muffins; curried eggs; chicken salads; iced vovos and MORE. The poor table was groaning, and the photo only shows 1/3rd of the fare on offer.
And what a variety of craft this month! Truly, the talent pool is amazing and it is no wonder the Buy or Barter Table is popular. The show and tell table included embroidered panels with divine dragonflies; woven lengths of cloth destined to be worn as vests; beanies with woven tops made on the knitters plastic circle loom; placemats skilfully finished and decorated; skeins of wool both dyed and naturally coloured; felted hats and scarves; toe-up socks; graduated dyed yarn re-skeined from knitted and dyed blanks; jumpers with a facet design; hat molds and yarn bowls crafted from Huon pine; wall hangings; baby spoons carved from rosewood; wooden handcrafted darning needles – and I’m sure I missed things. It is all so busy I have trouble keeping up with the pace.
We have the opportunity to join Jacqui in a felting technique in January, and Cindy will be taking names for interest in a Tatting tutorial in February. If there is anything you would like to share with the group, speak up, we all like to learn a new thing or two.
Merry Xmas everyone, and truly, may the New Year bring you health, happiness and prosperity. Looking forward to sharing it with you.

"Happy Gay Pride Month, we're taking away all of your representation," is basically what Netflix decided to say on June 1.
On the first day of Pride Month, Netflix announced that it was cancelling “Sense8,” a show that focuses on the intersectionality of race and sexuality with a sci-fi twist. Although the show has a large following, it seems as though Netflix is hinting that there weren’t enough viewers, which comes as a somewhat contradictory statement considering that advertising for the program was sparse and the second season aired nearly two years after the original. Of course, Netflix did cancel a few other shows, such as “Marco Polo” and “The Get Down.” But, it seems somewhat suspicious that most of the shows they are cancelling are inclusive shows, where the majority cast identify as people of color or LGBT. It’s simply possible that Netflix doesn’t really understand the true weight of cancelling these shows and more importantly, the shows they’re choosing to renew, such as Santa Clarita Diet, Hater’s Back Off, and One Day at a Time.
This era, the golden age of television and the Trump presidency, has given TV shows a chance to step up their representation. There are many shows that get a pat on the back for doing the bare minimum like Stranger Things for having one black character, but “Sense8” went above and beyond. “Sense8” included a transgender character played by a transgender actor, without making it a point that her trans background was a part of some agenda or plot point. They talked about cops and race in Chicago, politics and water in Africa, Big Pharma, drug addiction, mental illness and so much more.
Yet, it’s almost like Netflix wanted it to fail from the beginning. They spent nearly $9 million per episode during the second season according to Variety, but the cast never appeared in any late night talk shows or ads. More recently, after all of the backlash from fans through social media (including the hashtag #RenewSense8), Netflix commented on their Facebook page that regardless of protests, they would not bring back the show. They ironically shared a post by the Sense8 Facebook page that ended with #SensatesForever, referring to the name of the fans and the characters in the show. This shows how out of touch Netflix leaders, who are predominantly white and male, are with fans.
Shows like “Sense8” and “The Get Down” are important for LGBT representation, and unbeknownst to Netflix executives, these shows are cherished for that sole reason. Sadly, Netflix has fallen into a somewhat faux ally effect, in which they say that they believe in representation but they don’t actually try their best to give that to their customers. It’s almost as though director’s understand that they need to represent the gay community, but don’t know what to do with the characters (see “burying the gays” trope in“The 100,” “Orange is the New Black” and other shows).
By cancelling “Sense8,” Netflix executives are sending the message that inclusive television shows aren’t worth their time. By making statements such as, "we have to take more risk, you have to try more crazy things,” they’re saying they care more about the shock factor of their shows than the value to the people who need the representation. The end of “Sense8” makes for a lack of representation of the LGBT community on Netflix, echoing the president’s silence on Pride Month.
The mere fact that the LGBT community exists in real life as real people should be enough for CEO’s to understand the value of LGBT characters. Regardless of whether or not Netflix truly cares, if the support during America’s pride parades is any indication, media will eventually get there. We can only hope that another television provider will see the gap and fill it with a beautiful show that includes an array of people from all races and sexualities.My daughter and her friends: Are they laughing at you?*
*Nota bene
Today, 5 months after starting the process, I got the call that JC, the main man of neurology at my hospital, signed my Tysabri order. Which, apparently, means that tomorrow the infusion center will call me to schedule the first infusion. I have to get it scheduled before August 31, or else go back and do another series of MRIs of the brain and spine. I'd definitely prefer not to, since the stuff they put into the IV (I can't remember the name of it) makes me go loco. Seriously. I have a weird reaction to it. Gadolinium, I think it is.
I'm trying not to be whiney and complainy about my medical procedures. I don't do a very good job, though. My last MRI - a couple of months ago, turned out to be disturbing. They measure MS in terms of degrees of 'brain damage'. Basically, three categories - small, medium and large. Those aren't the actual words, but you get the drift. When I went to have the films reviewed, she said I was at the 'medium' level, which was new, and showed me a section on my corpus callosum which was also new. She showed me these lesions that looked like fingers - like a big, white, hand forming around that part of the brain. She said "this is a classic set of MS lesions", and that that particular area is where you'd see cognitive functionality being affected (one of my particular losses).
Later, when I went in to work, I was telling some friends about the big, white hand and we started referring to it as the "White People in My Brain". I've got white people in my brain!!! "Um, the white people in my brain are stopping me from understanding this Venn diagram...'
Another reason I dropped out of western medicine was because of things like this. Is it really helpful to know this? I really don't know. I wonder if, when it comes to damaging lesions in the brain, that ignorance might be bliss. I figure, you are going to experience whatever the damage is regardless of whether you saw it ahead of time.
The Tysabri news felt a bit bittersweet, because fellow MS'er Courtney had a bad reaction to her 2nd infusion yesterday, which was pretty heartbreaking for her. They say if you have an allergy, or sensitivity to it, it will most likely show on the 2nd one. Given the fear about PML, I've read they don't allow you to continue with the infusions after that. But that could be changing. There are been no new PML deaths since it went back on the market 14 months ago. Like me, Courtney seems to be a side effect magnet with the MS drugs. If we take it, they will come.
So, yesterday, I had the big mammo grammo. I don't know how long it has been since I had one. (My friend Paul said "let's see, when did St. Elmo's Fire come out?" Which just made me laugh like crazy.)
I had my reasons. The last time I had one, they sent me in for surgery to have a tumor removed. Benign, as it turned out. It was a very unpleasant procedure that I felt I shouldn't have had to do to begin with. I should have had the balls to ask them to do a needle biopsy first, but at that time I wasn't aggressive enough to do that. I tend to get intimidated by the white coats and lose my sense of self. Now, when I have an important appointment that might require decisions, I bring my friend Scotti. Scotti is awesome - she survived metastasized malignant melanoma, and she's a great procedure buddy. She was by my side during my period of really awful miscarriages, one of which was an emergency room surgical thing with massive blood loss. But I dropped out of western medicine world for a while there because, I think, I was tired of the drama.
I think it was about 14 years ago. So I was due. I'll pass on all the details of the mammo grammo (which Adam Sandler character says things like that? Opera man? Or the Louisiana guy? I started saying it because it made me laugh and thus feel less anxious.) Though I will say, the technician told me I looked like I was scared to death. Which I was. It was my first one since my 'enhancements' and I just could not imagine how this was going to happen.
It actually went remarkably well. Much less pain than the last time. It's funny - I have no reason to think that there are any other tumors or anything, but until they send me the "prognosis negative" letter, there's that period of waiting that tends to get on my nerves. Much like the Tysabri. I realized today, when I got the call, that I had had this undercurrent of "waiting anxiety" happening for several months.
I am just not that good with the waiting thing. However, in the last year of diagnosing Adrian's dyslexia, finding the right school for him, living through Dagny's 7th grade, having my job change, and trying to get the Tysabri thing in place, I have done a lot of it. And here I am, with many of those things resolved or at least having 'resolution potential'. I have taken most of these things quite literally one step at a time. I would often not know what the next step would be until I finished the current step. It's been a good lesson in that tortoise-and-the-hare kind of stuff.
Next up: 3rd grade, 8th grade, life on Tysabri? Here I come.
I've gotta get some sleep - I think the white people are moving furniture around up there.Job Description

This weeks topic is interesting. I always pick the wrong books for this situation. Usually I look for books like this when I got a reading slump or go on holiday and have to share my reading time with doing fun things. For example (and people familiar with the books will know this is not really the right choice) I brought the Matthew Shardlake series by C.J. Sansom on holiday last year. Interesting but not really light reading.
My light and fun picks and go to books are the following
- Anything by Elizabeth George (guess my loyal followers did not see that coming eh)
- Anything by John Sandford
- Rebecca by Daphe du Marier
- My favorite childhood books by Thea Beckman
- The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova
- Harry Potter
- Those cheap cosy mystery books you pick up at the supermarket

It’s a Thursday, so at 3pm I was doing my usual: trying to control Mini and Maxi Minxes whilst standing impatiently outside the nursery door, waiting on them opening up, getting anxious that yet again, we’re going to be late for ballet class. The nursery class appears to operate at 4 minutes slower than the rest of the
universe school. Over the Christmas holidays their clock’s gotten slower: it’s now about 6 minutes.
So there I was, hopping from one foot to the next, whilst pretending to look as nonchalent as you can when your blood-pressure’s sky-high, you’ve had a rough day, it’s freezing and the driving sleet is chilling you to your bones and you’re dreading an hour of shrieking banshee mini ballerinas. Some fat old troll waddles up, pushes past my girls and growls at the queue in general, “Are youse queueing for nursery?” A few of us muttered, “Aye” but I suspect we were all biting back various retorts along the lines of, “Naw, we’re queueing for the STD clinic: what have you got?”
Anyway, she squeezed herself to the front of the queue. One of the nursery teachers trilled, “No, you have to wait till the teacher releases your grandchild!” because, I think I’ve said before, they insist on the toddlers sitting down till *they* call them forward to meet you at the doorframe when you get to the head of the queue of parents. Anyway, Fatso gurgled, “Whit a load o’ rubbish! Here x, come on now, say goodbye to your teachers!”, waddled in, grabbed x, and squished on past. “That’s how you do it!” she smugly announced to the queue.
Around a million retorts fought amongst themselves in my head to be first to be spoken. Rude slurs like “I guess you really are Speshul and need to go first in case you piss your pants waiting”, “Are your piles too painful for you to stand waiting for a minute?”; truisms like, “No, really, you go first: age before beauty”; angry remarks like, “If you can’t be bothered to wait, then you’d better come earlier tomorrow”, “I’m in a hurry, too – are your piles more important than me getting to an appointment in time?” So: what witty, pithy retort made it? Wait for it… Here it is…
“Yeah, but, but… oh, I can’t be arsed”
Nice one, Trout. That really told her. Bet she’s smouldering over her cauldron right now, still beaming in shame. What a dork!
So yeah, I was furious at the old bag for being so rude, cross with the crowd for letting her, and boiling mad at myself for being too slow to even protest properly. Grrrrrr! And the thing is, as angry as I was, I could see her point. And I could also see an awful lot of myself in her; just 25 years older and 25 stone heavier.
You can imagine how my mood was when I got the girls to ballet and 2 uncontrolled kids were running screaming along the corridor and round and round the dining room, where the kids change. I tend to sit in the far corner out of the way – it stops me and all my millions of bags of *stuff* getting in everyone’s way, it’s a little quieter, and it’s easier for me to control my own wee horrors. So when the 2 hooligans raced past for a 4th time and ignored the tuts from me and 2 other mums, I muttered that once more and I’d trip them. Well, to be fair they’re only 8 or so, and what 8 year old even notices the existence of middle-aged mums, never mind that you might be getting in their way? So, on the 6th pass I put my arms up and said loudly and in a low voice, “OK, you need to stop running now – you nearly knocked over the baby. Enough. Stop”
Lo and behold, Mummy Hooligan stepped forward suddenly and had a word with them. Aaaaaaaah, so that’s who owned them? They resumed their shrill screeching and chasing up and down, knocking things over, but in the corridor away from my toddler at least. Though that little toddler kept making a bee-line for a teeny-tiny baby girl in a car seat, right the other end of the room. I had let Mini dress herself up like a dog’s dinner (pink wool dress, pink and blue wellies, enormous pink frothy ballet skirt, too-big sheepskin coat with flapping mits, too-small pink and blue earflap hat perched on the top of her head with a football-sized pompom) so at least the sight of her gave everyone a tiny bit of warning of the impending doom as she stormed towards them. Luckily I intercepted Mini in time before she touched the wee baby, but it was (shame-facedly) close. And as usual Midi chose those moments to run off in the direction of the door opening onto the car park. Talk about torn…
And I solved the mystery of the vanishing food and drink. Finally! Two or 3 times I’ve run out of snacks and drinks for the minxes: Maxi’s finished her lesson and I’ve gone to give her the last juice carton, orange and tub of raisins, only to find something missing. Each time, I’ve found the wrapper or peel in the bucket, so I’ve assumed that stupidly, in my sleep-deprived haze, that I’ve fed a younger minx twice. Today I noticed a wee girl lean over the table, smiling away, licking her lips and all but drooling, swaying in her seat. As the arcs of her sways brought her closer to the juice cartons and pots of raisins lying in front of Midi and Mini, she stopped pretending to smile at the girls and gleefully slabbered at the food. On the 4th sway she was within grabbing range and there was no doubt whatsoever that she was planning a grab and run raid. I leaned over, snapped the lids on the pots and moved the cartons nearer to me. She looked at me, scowled, and slunk off. Guess she’s away to look up ‘subtlety’ in the dictionary.
I’m not ending this post on a downer. This morning I decided that I needed a treat, so me, Midi and Mini headed into the heaving metropolis of Elgin and bothered 2 nice, quiet ladies in our favourite coffee shop – they were just enjoying a quiet scone and a coffee, minding their own business. I did feel sorry that me and the girls shattered their peace, but honestly, I kept my commands and orders as quiet as I could. And the girls didn’t spill or splash anything. Baby Mini clearly said a new word, “Draw! Draw!”, which impressed me hugely – we rarely go to Scribbles yet she’d remembered that you get a wee piece of paper and crayons to draw with. She and Midi even shared the crayons without trying to eat them / stab each other. They drank their strawberry milkshakes neatly, gobbled up half an Empire biscuit each (Midi placated because I whispered that she’d gotten the biggest half), troughed half my scone, and drew a map back to the car, each. I feel sorry that we were noisy, but I must admit that we 3 had a cracking great half hour.Army Corps proposes dredging Mississippi River for bigger cargo ships
The Army Corps of Engineers wants the Mississippi River to be dredged so three southeast Louisiana ports can accept the bigger cargo ships built to take advantage of the Panama Canal's expansion.
Several other U.S. ports either have already completed similar projects or are trying to get them approved.
Parts of the shipping channel are now about 42 to 45 feet deep. The plan calls for increasing that depth to 50 feet.
NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune reported that the Army Corps plans to use some of the dredged-up silt to make more than 1,460 acres of new wetlands.
The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development would pay $45.7 million of the estimated $88.9 million cost. The Corps estimates $96.8 million in net annual benefits to the U.S. economy.

I do not 'chide' slow motorists, but look for an opportune moment to overtake their vehicle. It is best to stay calm while driving. Displaying anger on the road is not going to help us in any way. Shouting at another motorist amounts to road rage. Doing so also takes our attention off the road because we become immersed in venting our anger at someone who is in the middle of an important lesson.

I hardly drive the vehicle but I comfortably sit when someone is driving. The traffic in Bangalore is worse and is getting worse day by day and we definitely lose our patience because of the traffic. Even to travel for a distance of 6-10 KMS it takes more than 45 minutes and spending more time in traffic everyday is frustrating. Because of this we lose our patience. Though I don't ride the vehicle I lose my calm but still I sit quiet and my husband will definitely get into argument with others on road. He fights or scolds one or the other person almost everyday because everyone will be in hurry to reach the destination out of which they might jump the signal or drive rash and this irritated other drivers on road.

While driving, irrespective of two wheeler or four wheeler or any wheeler, we should keep a cool head with patience. We should not abuse or pick up altercations with the slow drivers and divert our attention from driving. Be cool, be slow and steady while driving inside the cities. Don't chide the slow drivers, and think that you were also a slow driver and learner once upon a time. Of course, on the highways, I will ensure my Padmini overtakes all the vehicles in the front.

Admitting that persistent inflation, especially in the food sector, is a cause of concern, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday emphasised on increasing the country's agricultural production to enhance food security.
"We have to make a concerted effort to enhance our food security. . . Our economy has been in reasonably good shape in the past seven years. We have achieved an impressive rate of growth, which we were able to sustain even in the midst of the worst global financial crisis of recent times.
"However, during the past year and a half, persistent inflation, especially in the food sector, has become a cause of concern," Singh said at the inauguration of Civil Services Day in New Delhi.

PM on why persistent inflation is a cause of concern
The government's consistent policy has been to control inflation without hurting growth, Singh said, emphasising that "we have strived for a delicate and difficult balance to achieve this."
Food prices have been on upswing since the drought in 2009, which affected the agriculture output.
Although the situation has improved in recent months, with food inflation coming down to single digit levels, the long-term solution lies in increasing production and productivity in the agricultural sector, Singh said.
Food inflation for the week ended April 9 reversed the declining trend for three weeks, rising by 8.74 per cent as against 8.28 per cent in the previous week.

PM on why persistent inflation is a cause of concern
On monthly basis, food inflation for the month of March was recorded at 8.98 per cent, higher than the Reserve Bank of India's target of 8 per cent.
"The needs of a growing and increasingly more prosperous population can only be met by enhanced production of a diversified basket of agricultural products," he said while
pointing out that the Civil Services again have a major role to play in achieving a higher rate of growth in the farm sector.
"I hope you will pay more focused attention to this area, and more specifically to the preparation and implementation of district level agricultural plans," he said.

PM on why persistent inflation is a cause of concern
With monsoon likely to be normal this year, the Planning Commission is hoping to achieve the targetted four per cent or more growth in the farm sector.
This will be crucial to achieve overall nine per cent economic growth in the current financial year.
The Prime Minister also took the opportunity to lay stress on the importance of strengthening local level governance through panchayats and municipalities.

"Our country is too large to be governed effectively from the Centre or even from the state capitals. We have to decentralise power, decentralise decision-making and
decentralise the implementation of various development schemes," he said.
"The success of third tier of governance is critical to improved delivery of services and better design and implementation of scheme", Singh said, adding, "our civil servants must do their utmost to facilitate real decentralisation of governance in our country."

Today was another interesting day at Muhimbili. Shelton and Erica had a the opportunity to experience Journal Club. Our resident, Imran, was presenting for journal club this week and his paper was a recent New England Journal paper about peanut allergy in infants.
Presentations such as Journal Club or Grand Rounds are an experience here. Everywhere you go people have sort of “assigned seats,” we all just tend to sit in the same place when we attend certain events. Well, at pediatric presentations it is official. The room is organized such that the medical students sit in the back of the room, then the interns, then the residents, then the registrars and then there is a row of special seats in the front for the attendings/specialists. Then when the presenation finishes the lead asks by section if there are any questions. I haven’t been to a ton of these over time but it seems there are never questions from the medical students or the interns and rarely by the residents. Occasional questions that are good from the registrars. Then come the specialists. They always make comments or ask questions and the learning style is quite diffferent than we are used to. I’m not sure that the questions are so much geared at helping the group learn as they are at making the presenter feel moderately uncomfortable. Per Imran, several interns have already cried this year during presentations. Very different system.
So, it occurred to me today after Journal Club that our style of teaching involves a lot of asking questions to promote discussion, such as “What is your differential diagnosis?” “What are you thinking when you are deciding to make that plan?” “What do you think is going on with this patient?” And it occurred to me that perhaps that might be intimidating to the docs here because of the system they train in. That they might think I’m trying to trip them up. So we discussed it and I clarified that when I ask questions I’m not specifically looking to point out something they are doing wrong, just to promote group learning. They told me they had figured that out about us over the years but the resident and past-resident did say they wished their system of learning was more like ours.
After Journal Club, this woman who I have never met before announced that the medical students should come meet with her and then pointed at the 3 of us and said we were to come too. I told her that we were not medical students but I was told we were to come at 10am to her office. I was a bit taken back by that summons not knowing who she was or what the purpose of the meeting was in the middle of rounds. Our Tanzanian Master’s Students apologized to us for her stating that was her personality and that she was the Head of Pediatrics. Well, turns our she just wanted to know who we were and that all went fine after I clarified that I and our group had been coming for many years. She is new from previous years so this was never a requirment in the past. We’ll remember it for the future.
Aside from that I helped with a couple of difficult bone marrows today, we rounded, Shelton took a field trip with Shakilu to radiology to get a couple of CT reads that we have been waiting on since last week, and we continue to hope that tomorrow the flow machine might be fixed so we can figure out what some of these leukemia patients have. One repair person came from Nairobi last week and couldn’t fix it and another one was coming today. So cross your fingers–only if you are in the US, because here it apparently means something rude.
That’s about all for me today. Hope everyone is well at home!

A+D Retail Store Design has designed Joanna Klimas Atelier, located in Warsaw, Poland.
Our client`s wish was to create a space that combines the shop, café and showroom. A place where customers could try on clothes designed by Joanna Klimas, have a talk drinking good coffee and enjoy fashion albums from the owner’s private collection. In addition, the designer wanted to get a space that will allow fashion shows to be commited.
The starting point was the question of how to give style designed by Joanna Klimas clothes through the character of the interior so as to constitute an organic whole.
Joanna Klimas has repeatedly stated that she wants woman to be dressed, not dressed up. Her designs are simple in form and free of unnecessary ornamentation, yet suprisingly expressive and fresh. And so it was to be inside the studio.
We decided to preserve the unique atmosphere of the Warsaw Muranów from the 1950s by respecting the existing interior details. We`ve avoided excessive interference with the historic interior, at the same time not wanting to reproduce its former appearance. Using the original hardwood floors, wall texture, and window bars we worked to create a fresh, minimalist interiors that would be clear and subtle background for Mrs.` Klimas projects.
Atelier on Muranowska is an open space consisting of two rooms (4.5 meters of height) finished with Socialist Realist original stucco and connected by monumental portal. We are especially proud of the mezzanine, which, thanks to the unique design is very functional, but is also the main decoration of the area. By doing this we`ve obtained the surface on which normally are situated café tables and reading area. During fashion shows it changes into stands for spectators. Light, openwork structure covered with glass, doesn`t overwhelm the interior, and light flows freely to the ground floor level, where multi-functional wardrobe is. Elegant stairs, referring to the shape of sewing scissors retain lightness, even carrying large loads.
The entire mezzanine was highlighted with more than 120 lamps with adjustable intensity in six exhibition areas, which allows perfect lighting during the show area on ground floor level.
The obtained effect responds to the needs of our client. Open interior, where clothes are created directly in front of clients, does not hide anything.

bongey writes: Palmer Lucky has left Facebook, which bought Oculus for $2 billion. The anti-Hillary memes controversy led to the resignation. UploadVR reports: "According to Oculus, this will be Palmer's last week with Friday marking his official last day as an employee of Facebook. In an official statement, the company said that: .' When asked if Luckey's departure was voluntary, Facebook representatives declined to comment, citing a policy of not discussing internal personnel matters. This revelation comes around one year after Luckey himself hand-delivered the first consumer Oculus Rift to a pre-order customer in Alaska. In just over 12 months, the 24-year-old transformed from the face of one of the tech world's most well-known teams into a bit of a recluse, disappearing from public view during the 2016 US presidential election and emerging only for an appearance in court."

Steven R. McQueen, who exited everyone working in the CW’s supernatural series back in February after six years of playing Elena Gilbert’s (Nina Dobrev) younger brother Jeremy, has landed the recurring role of Jimmy Borelli, a new candidate at Firehouse 51, for season four of NBC’s drama. Borelli makes a dramatic entrance on his first day at work that doesn’t sit well with Chief Boden (Eamonn Walker).
We have to admit, we never would have picked Chicago Fire as McQueen’s first post-TVD gig just because he’s spent the past few years heavily campaigning to join a superhero show! The TVD alum (Steven R. McQueen) tweeted at the Arrow writers room many times about guest starring on the comic book show as Nightwing and he was serious about his pitch.
Steven R. McQueen twitted “I started tweeting the Arrow writer’s room and I was like, ‘You should be me to guest star as Nightwing. I wrote them jokingly and they ended up tweeting casting. So I am putting that energy in the universe! It’s on camera now, it’s gotta happen!”.

“The data collected in this survey will allow us to identify spatial information for recreational uses in the Northeast,” says Melissa Gates, Surfrider Foundation’s Northeast Regional Manager. “As demands on our coastal and marine areas grow, this data will be integral to planning for the health of the ocean and recreational areas.”
The Surfrider Foundation is collecting information from recreational users through this survey from November 13, 2014 to midnight on April 30, 2015. Information collected will include where and how people recreate along New England’s coast, including beach going, wildlife viewing, surfing and non-motorized boating.
Register to take the survey:!
The online survey results will be published in a final report and spatial data layers will be incorporated into the Northeast Ocean Data Portal, to assist the Northeast Regional Planning Body with the ocean planning process. This information will also be combined in the portal with data being collected from recreational industries including commercial whale watching, diving, and marine events.
“Any successful ocean planning effort relies on science-based, credible information about our ocean uses and natural resources, collected through tools like this recreational use survey. By better understanding the regional nature of ocean activities, habitat, marine life and ocean processes, we can work together to make more informed decisions about how we manage the ocean here in New England,” says Betsy Nicholson from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and federal co-lead of the Northeast Regional Planning Body.
Coastal recreation is widely practiced throughout the United States, but little data exists on what activities people participate in, where these uses occur, and the related economic benefits. To address this need the Surfrider Foundation, and its partner Point 97, a leader in technology solutions for ocean and coastal management, are involved in similar studies across the coastal U.S., including a completed effort in the state of Oregon as well as the Mid-Atlantic region, and a recently launched study in Washington State.

In 125 markets measured in the first half of 2015, Sprint has been awarded a total of 180 first place (outright or shared) RootScore® Awards for overall, reliability, speed, data, call, or text network performance.1 This is significant considering that for the first half of 2014 Sprint had achieved just 27 award wins in these same 125 markets. In Kansas City, home to Sprint’s headquarters, RootMetrics ranked the network No. 1 in a tie for overall performance. A few days later, Sprint received a shared No. 1 ranking for overall network performance in Indianapolis.
A few years ago Sprint battled negative perceptions during a “pardon our dust” period as it rebuilt, optimized and invested in its network. Some retail and business customers fled to other wireless carriers, but thousands have eagerly returned, and subscriber numbers are on the upswing.
One business is Rocco Fiore & Sons, a landscape architecture company in Libertyville, Illinois, a suburb north of Chicago.
In late June of 2013, Sprint shut down its outdated iDEN network, the technology band that Rocco

“We immediately had network and account issues with the new carrier,” said Adam Clark, Rocco Fiore IT director since 2005. “It was a rocky road. Our employees were used to the mobile radio feature with the Sprint push-to-talk phones. This put us in a jam, yet we still had to serve our customers with the same efficiency they were used to.”
Sprint Solutions Engineer Brian Handler and Account Manager Mike Litscher didn’t give up on Rocco Fiore and continued talks with Clark. In 2013, with network improvement plans underway, both were confident they could regain the Rocco Fiore account.
“Our company and CEO stepped up with sorely needed network improvements and other worthwhile investments in Chicago,” Handler says. “Mike and I knew we now had the tools, improved technology and the belief to make a strong pitch to Adam. We were suddenly on an equal – no, better – playing field that our competitors.”
.jpg)
“Sprint bends over backwards to help,” Clark says. “Troubleshooting is easy, and they address problems quickly. I’m glad its network is performing so well because for Rocco Fiore to win, we have to communicate wirelessly quickly and effectively in the office and with managers and field employees.”
This spring Sprint made a huge investment in America’s third largest city with Sprint® for Chicago. The program will bring more than 300 new jobs to neighborhoods throughout Chicago by the end of 2015 and includes the installation of hundreds of new network cell sites and an expected investment of $45 million in its network infrastructure by the end of 2016.
A few weeks after launching Sprint for Chicago, CEO Marcelo Claure hired Tracy Nolan as president and general manager for the company in Illinois and Wisconsin. The newly created position enables Sprint to devote more resources to and focus on key cities in the Midwest, including Chicago and Milwaukee. Nolan oversees sales strategy, network oversight, customer service, marketing communications and general operations in the area.
“We have what we need to succeed, as well as ensuring that the network and purchasing experience is the best it can possibly be,” Nolan says. “Our consumers and business customers in Illinois and Chicago will have so many new options of where and how they can purchase new Sprint devices and get them serviced. The time is now for Sprint to win in Chicago.”
1.Who Gets Preventive Care?
| December 19, 2011 people, who become enrolled in Medicare as a result of receiving Social Security benefits, also automatically receive an enrollment package that discusses the 'Welcome to Medicare exam. What about those haven't yet taken their Social Security benefits or continue to work after they turn 65? Apparently they're on their own to find out. Seniors are also entitled to an Annual Wellness Visit, designed to focus on delivering preventive health services. The exam is free if the doctor accepts Medicare's payment. If the doctor orders tests and procedures not covered under the exam, the patient may incur some expense most likely covered by a Medigap policy or a Medicare Advantage plan.
Despite these free exams designed to catch illness early, barriers remain. One is that doctors themselves don't know the rules or disregard them. A few weeks ago a 72-year-old New York City man on Medicare asked his long-time doctor for a pneumonia vaccination. The doctor refused unless he paid him $300 up front. This vaccination is considered the standard of care for people over age sixty-five and protects against some kinds of pneumonia, a potentially deadly disease. That's why Medicare covers it.
During a subsequent visit, the man again asked for the vaccine and advised the doctor that Medicare covered the injection. This time the doctor said he had no vaccine available, and if he wanted the shot, he should go elsewhere. It was too expensive to keep on hand, he said, because there was no demand from his patients. Maybe that's why he was trying to get his patient to pay out of pocket. Or maybe his patients didn't know they should have the shot. But that raises another question: why wasn't he reminding his patients they needed the vaccination, which would prompt them to get it?
Let's face it. Patients themselves put off getting preventive care perhaps because they are afraid of what it might reveal. Roadblocks like the man encountered make the task of getting the care that much harder. It's easy to blame Medicare for not reminding people more often about what it covers. It's easy to blame the docs for not delivering the right kind of care either for financial reasons or sloppy medical practice.
Patients themselves bear some responsibility too. It's important to read the Medicare Handbook, as dense as it may be, and it's important to challenge your physicians when they don't provide good care. The New York man is reluctant to find a new doctor. Why? Do you know how hard it is at this age to find a new doctor and start over, he says. You can't change doctors as easily as you can go to another restaurant that pads the bill.' It's the old trust factor in medicine. We tend to trust even when we shouldn't.September 2017 - March 2018
This project is located at the intersection of genre theory, the history of reading, and the Ethical Turn in contemporary literary studies. Drawing on canonical texts by Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry James, I examine the ways in which authors of fiction in the United States in the latter half of the nineteenth century articulated anxieties about the novelistic teleologies of plot, coming of age, and didacticism. I argue that ontologically errant protagonists - by fleeing from the narrator, circumventing interiority, exceeding or contravening narrative temporality, and developing out of sync with narrative events - critique the formal burdens of the novel, seeking relief from its relentless forward momentum, its structural reliance on psychological centrality, its overweening techniques of exposition, and its privileging of individual progress. Stealing from the Story shows how the paradigm of evasion connects mimetic territories as diverse as the detective story, the tale, the romance, and the Bildungsroman.
Elizabeth Brogden received her PhD in English Literature from Johns Hopkins University in 2016, with a dissertation on “para-novelistic” modes of writing and reading in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Her main areas of research include the poetics of genre, the history of reading, aesthetic and ethical theory, and visual culture in the long nineteenth century. She has published articles on Henry James and Nella Larsen in NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction and Studies in American Fiction and is finishing her first book, entitled Stealing from the Story: Forms of Narrative Evasion in the Age of the Novel. She is also an affiliated fellow at the Institute for Cultural Inquiry.

Sunkern (Neo Genesis 78)
From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia.
Sunkern (Japanese: ヒマナッツ Himanuts) is a Grass-type Basic Pokémon card. It is part of the Neo Genesis expansion.

Release information
This card was originally released in the Neo Genesis expansion with artwork by Kagemaru Himeno. It was later reprinted with new artwork by the same artist in Japan as a promotional card for the fourth volume of the manga series, How I Became a Pokémon Card released in August 2000. The Japanese promotional version was printed on non-glossy card stock.

Trivia
- The Japanese promotional version has an open book symbol in place of an expansion symbol. It is also commonly known as Natta Wake Sunkern in reference to the manga book in which it was distributed.
Origin
Growth and Mega Drain are both moves in the Pokémon games that Sunkern can learn. This card's Pokédex entry comes from Pokémon Gold, though it is slightly reworded.Notes on Lavender in Eaux de Cologne & Further Thoughts on By Kilian Prelude To Love {Scented Thoughts}
Lavandin Abrialis
Reviewing By Kilian Prelude To Love yesterday, I puzzled over the question of why this young and exclusive niche perfume house had decided to compose a bold citrus-y fragrance, quite literally plugging into a group of notes that from a certain perspective can smell a bit plain. Or perhaps I would not have asked myself this question had the jus smelled different.
The next puzzle I have had in mind is why they had decided to take on the added challenge of doing not only a citrus-y perfume but also do it in a rather minimalist, even straightforward style? It seems to compound the difficulty of attempting to uplift the lemons and mandarins from the level of the mundane. Indeed, the resulting impression makes you perceive the difference existing between metaphorically expensive and literally expensive...
In this case the proportion of citruses remain important and even rich, so the lavandin does not act as replacement for more expensive citrus fruits and a more accessible and substitutive source of freshness. It even creates here a pleasant oxygenated feel.
I am all ready to accept the argument that rougher materials can be used for a certain desired effect.
Going back also to Escale à Portofino, which smelt more elegant and "expensive", I note that it does not contain lavender nor lavandin.
It may well be that unconsciously we are used to smelling different grades of fineness in eaux de Cologne and that this puts a constraint on the free use of lavender or lavandin in a modern eau de Cologne formula.
This problem however, I do not feel for a lavender cologne like (vintage) Yardley English Lavender, when the lavender is the main carefully chosen focus.“We..” ~John Kuhn

Custodial History
Arrived separately, WG ref CC0054.Someone asked online the other day whether the church I attend has a dress code, saying she didn’t have “dress-up” clothes and didn’t want to feel out of place. I responded by saying, no, there’s no dress code there. Come as you are!
She said thanks.
Someone else took that a step further, saying that any church that has a dress code is being exclusive.
I let that go because I didn’t want to get political over a sincere question. But I do have a response.
Dressing up
While churches should welcome all who visit, I grew up in a church that did have a dress code. I wore a suit and tie to church as a teenager. (Perhaps that’s where my lifelong rebellion to ties comes from.)
While a suit and tie (or a long dress) is not a symbol of comfort, it has a specific purpose. Those who wear formal clothes, in a business or church setting, are showing off their best side. Formality shows dignity and respect to those we interact with.
Again, formal clothes are not meant for comfort (although they shouldn’t be distractingly uncomfortable). They serve a higher purpose. We are giving our best. We have standards. It costs money to buy formal clothes, and in certain settings, they are necessary.
Weddings and funerals require more than T-shirt and flip-flops. Why? Respect for those we are honoring.
Dressing down
Having no dress code on Sunday mornings is fine, to make sure that no one is excluded. But I think we’ve taken that thought too far. We are so casual, we’ve forgotten who the God of the universe really is. It’s hard to offer respect in a T-shirt and flip-flops. We can start there with God, but should we remain there our whole lives?
I’m reading the book of Leviticus in the Bible with a group of friends. It’s a long list of rules for animal and grain sacrifices, purification rituals and standards for daily living. It’s hard reading. Does it even apply to 21st century America?
Oh, yes. My study Bible offers this commentary:
We may be tempted to dismiss Leviticus as a record of bizarre rituals of a different age. But its practices made sense to the people of the day and offer important insights for us into God’s nature and character.
Israel, from the day God formed the nation, had to follow different rules than every other nation did. Israel was set apart. Its standards for living were much higher. The Israelites didn’t always appreciate that. At one point they wanted a king, solely because every other nation had one. God said He was their king, but that wasn’t good enough for them. God said fine, but you’ll have problems as a result. And they did.
Holy standards
The higher standards remained, even as Israel rebelled.
The Ten Commandments, as well as all the Levitical laws and rules, didn’t apply outside Israel. But inside Israel, they did.
God had something special planned for the nation. The higher standards benefited Israel as much as it did giving God the honor and respect He deserved. Do not commit adultery, for example: When we do commit adultery, the side effects are obvious and horribly damaging. But we do it anyway, don’t we?
As Christians who inherit this lifestyle, we are held to this higher standard. It’s easy to point fingers at us when we fall short. We all do, you know, whether we admit it or not.
Here’s the kicker: Those outside the church by definition aren’t following God’s standards. They follow their own man- (and woman)-made rules, many of which are based on Biblical principles (again, whether we admit that or not).
Where God’s standards and man’s standards differ is where we clash. Hard. It’s difficult to find compromise when we see life through different eyes. I’m not talking Republican and Democrat; I’m talking much bigger than that. I’m talking Christian and non-Christian.
Those two groups read the Bible differently, and here’s the explanation. Do we read Leviticus, for example, as a list of bizarre rituals, or insight into our holy God? Same words, two totally different meanings.
Best foot forward
The business world understands this better than the church does. Business executives put their best foot forward to lure customers to their product or service. If a business cuts corners, customers eventually will find out – and leave for a competitor.
High standards have a cost. Businesses have to put out time and money to research and build the best products and services, and then they charge us accordingly to consume them.
With God, the high standards are a lifestyle choice. That choice affects the way we think and live, the lens through which we see life. Are we willing to submit to a high standard, or not?
There are consequences and side effects whichever choice we make.
With God, it’s not a decide-once-and-live-happily-ever-after decision. Perhaps that’s why so few people accept God’s standards. It’s a daily thing. When we fall short, we ask God (and each other, when necessary) for forgiveness. Then we do it again. Forgive, and be forgiven. Seventy times seven times, in Jesus’ words.
I wish more people in the church understood holiness. In our efforts at being casual, it’s a lost theme.
But God is God and the standards remain, whether anyone follows them or not. Israel learned that the hard way over time in Old Testament days. I fear we are learning that the hard way today as well.At the request of @Malky heres a step by step article of a picture I did a while ago for the, unfortunately short-lived, Custom Paint Magazine.

“C’mon, lad. Like I said, we don’t have much time, and no time at all for bull crap.”
“Yes,” Michael said, not believing he admitted it.
“Good boy. That’s the only honest answer any man could give, because there’s not a single breathing one of us that hasn’t thought about killing someone at least once in his life. Now here’s the more important question: Why didn’t you?”
Michael laughed. He thought Paul was joking. Until he looked in his eyes. “Fuck, dude! Because I don’t want to go jail!”
“Of course not!” Paul roared back. He seemed so happy that Michael smiled along with him. “But what if you couldn’t be caught? What would stop you then?”
“Because it’s wrong, dude! You don’t go around killing everybody you’re pissed at!”
“I do,” Paul said quietly. Then he corrected himself. “Well, not everyone. I’ll need a nuclear arsenal for that. Everyone I really want to.”
Michael swallowed hard. “Dude, I’m out of here,” he said, jumping from the couch.
Paul slammed him back down to the couch like he was swatting a fly. “Could it be you’ve abandoned your pledge so quickly? In my clan we take our vows with the utmost solemnity. To break an oath is unthinkable, and those that do suffer the harshest of reprisals, dealt by the very hand of destiny itself!”
“But I can’t…I don’t want to kill anyone!” Michael sputtered.
“Of course, you do,” Paul said with a finality that left no room for further argument. “You just need to give yourself permission. I told you we don’t have any time for nonsense, Michael. So sit, listen and learn.”
Michael sat, freaked out of his gourd at the direction their conversation had taken—and the vow that loomed over his head like a gleaming guillotine blade. He hadn’t thought that one out too carefully, had he?
“Here’s another way to look at it⎯” Paul continued, his smile back in full bloom as he rose from the couch, pacing in long strides as he spoke. “Let’s say you were drafted into the army and sent halfway around the world to shoot, stab and drop huge, fiery bombs on people you didn’t even know, much less have any grudge against. Worse yet, let’s say your virtuous government actually made up a great big pack of lies to justify why it was so necessary for you to risk your life and claim the souls of all those completely innocent victims. Even with all that bullshit, it would still be okay for you to march over there, point your rifle at someone’s unlucky head, pull the trigger and blow his brains out, right? And why? Because you’re a soldier! You’re under orders! It isn’t just okay for you to kill those people! It’s your duty!”
“Yeah, that’s some pretty fucked-up shit,” Michael agreed, his smile slowly returning, though much shakier with the reminder of his promise still ringing in his ears.
“Fucked up, indeed! What gives your not-so-freely-elected government the right to tell you when it’s your duty to kill someone…and then, using the same false claim of authority, command you to die in the electric chair for having the gall to pick your own battles, to wage wars of your own choosing, against your own enemies, against the people who threaten your life directly, not in some abstract sense, veiled with obscene notions of honor and righteousness—real people—who mean real harm to yourself, your family, and the noble principles of your own calling! What if you had a new country, with its own rules and regulations, its own mandate of authority? What if you were a soldier in your own war and not a foot soldier either—a general? Would it be okay for you to take a life in the due course of achieving your own strategic objectives? Or would it be even more than okay? Perhaps it would it be your divine right…your duty!”
Michael sat mesmerized, more terrified and excited than he’d ever felt before. What Paul was saying spat in the face of every conventional notion of morality that had been stuffed into his brain since he was old enough to think. Yet it made so much sense!
“Aye, son. Freedom is a terrible responsibility,” Paul said kindly. “But don’t be afraid. Least not of me. I’m here to help in a way that no one else in this awful world can.”
“What are you saying, man?” Michael implored, his anxiety mounting by the second.
“What I’m saying is this: The world is a very scary place for all of the sheep. But for the wolves…it’s paradise.”
Licking your chops for more? Paul awaits you here.Solid Beauty Advice On How To Look Good In The Morning

Another successful Christmas on the books, but what are you going to do with all those leftovers? Don’t put away those stretchy pants just yet, because we’ve pulled together a few creative ideas for turning those traditional holiday dishes and sides into some pretty amazing second-time-around meals. So, get ready to clear out those fridge shelves and get your taste buds ready for the New Year with these Christmas leftover hacks. Bon appétit!
Broccoli & Turkey Casserole
Turkey is one of the most common leftovers following a big Christmas Day feast. If you’re tired of those same old boring turkey sandwiches, this recipe idea should kick things up a notch. Just combine a few cups of shredded turkey with a package of cooked broccoli florets in a greased casserole dish. Top with a mixture of 1/3 cup of milk and 1 can each cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and cheddar cheese, bake for 20-25 minutes at 400 degrees, serve and enjoy.
Ham, Cheese & Veggie Quiche
If it’s leftover ham that you’re dealing with, we’ve got you covered. How about a nice ham, cheese and veggie quiche? All you need are a few of your favorite veggies (we prefer spinach, onions and mushrooms, but you can substitute with just any combo your heart desires), some milk, egg whites, three kinds (or more) of cheese and a handful of other ingredients. Check out the full recipe here (and just add in some chopped up leftover ham). Have it for breakfast, a snack or even a meal. Yum!
Turkey & White Bean Chili
Chili is a super easy, deliciously hearty way to transform leftovers into something new. This version combines fresh turkey meat with a variety of beans, a few veggies, fresh minced garlic and a whole lot of flavor. Best of all, since it’s made in the crockpot, you won’t have to spend all day cooking. Just melt two ounces of butter in a warm crockpot, add a few teaspoons of flour to thicken and combine chicken broth, beans, peppers and onions, spices to taste and pulled turkey. Cover and cook for four hours and enjoy. For the complete recipe, click here.
Christmas Risotto
Who doesn’t love good old comfort food? At Hanover Foods, when we think of comfort food, we think of risotto. It’s so rich, creamy, hearty and flavorful. And if you make it with riced cauliflower, you can skip most of the carbs and calories at the same time. To put a Christmas leftover spin on things, make your risotto using your favorite recipe, and then slowly stir in some leftover turkey and stuffing. Toss in a little garlic and some lemon zest and you’ll have a quick, easy and creative new dish to enjoy.
Ham & Bean Soup
What better way to relax, unwind and recover after the crazy holiday rush than to cozy up with a steaming bowl of hearty soup? This recipe is designed to taste just like Grandma used to make, using a ham with the bone, but don’t worry if you’ve only got the meat leftover. Simply take a bit of ham, sauté or bake it until it’s almost crispy, then chop it up. This should add a deeper flavor. The rest of the recipe, including the rest of the ham you’ve got on hand, can be followed as planned.
Lots of leftovers? No problem. With these after-Christmas cooking hacks, you’ll be able to enjoy a versatile and delicious menu for as long as it takes to clear out the fridge and get ready for the New Year! For more great recipes, click here.reviewer's rating ★★★★★
In Short Big Sur and the Post Ranch Inn were definitely the highlight of our trip.
To ElaborateFor our honeymoon, we chose to do something that involved less travel than we had initially planned (we had originally planned to go to Greece/Italy). We ultimately landed on doing a trip down the California coast. Big Sur and the Post Ranch Inn were definitely the highlight of our trip. Each room is essentially a standalone treehouse or water-view cottage. The property is incredibly private and secluded in a way that lends itself perfectly to a honeymoon stop. I will say that 3 nights is the most I would recommend for the Post Ranch Inn. Aside from relaxing in the spectacular infinity hot tubs, visiting the spa or going for a hike in the beautiful hills, there is a not a lot else to do off the property. The town of Big Sur itself is also tiny and there are maybe 1-2 other restaurants worth visiting (otherwise you are eating breakfast, lunch and dinner on the Post Ranch Inn property). I would recommend that if you are doing a Pacific Coast trip you also visit / start in Napa (Yountville in particular) and stop for 2 nights at the San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito (outside Santa Barbara).

Michael McCall has been a game warden in Comal County for almost ten years. He says most of the accidents he has responded to over the years on Canyon Lake are preventable.
"A lot of the accidents or injuries or deaths could have been prevented by wearing a life jacket," McCall said.
McCall said that if you head out to the lake, stay away from restricted areas. Not only can you get a citation from park rangers, the consequences can be deadly. A teenager from Canyon Lake died last week after jumping off cliffs in a restricted area of the lake.
"The water is unforgiving so if something bad happens it usually goes from a really fun day at the lake to a really tragic day at the lake in just a matter of moments," McCall said.
At the Comal River in New Braunfels, emergency responders say 80 percent of their water rescues happen between Memorial Day and Labor Day.
"During the course of the summer we respond to a lot of missing kids or near drownings. These are beautiful waters, wonderful places to come play and have a good time, but I think people take them for granted. It's a natural waterway, it's not a ride at an amusement park," Patrick O'Connell, from the New Braunfels Fire Department said.
They say in the span of a few yards, the river's depth and turbulence can change dramatically. It's important to wear a life jacket if you're not a good swimmer and to keep in mind that jumping into the water from anywhere is not allowed.

The unique color and texture of Fresh Umbrian Clay Toothpaste result from the high concentration of pure white clay from the earth of Nocera Umbra, Italy. The discovery of white clay tablets inside the tombs of Etruscans in the 6th century BC suggest that white clay possessed mystical meaning for this ancient civilization. As early as the 1500s, doctors, scientists and naturalists remedy to heal eczema, dermatitis and other skin irritations; treat insect bites; relieve muscular pains and improve oral hygiene.
White clay controls the build-up of plaque, helping to maintain healthy gums. These natural qualities of white clay make Fresh Umbrian Clay toothpaste highly effective. When used on a regular basis, the mild abrasive properties result in visible whitening action without damage to the tooth enamel. As a natural pain reliever, this toothpaste is especially helpful for people with sensitive and/or inflamed gums.
Fresh Umbrian Clay Toothpaste is free of any artificial whiteners, colorants, thickeners, synthetic flavorings or preservatives and sodium laureth sulfate. By keeping the ingredients in their natural state, the formulation allows the unique natural qualities of white clay to deliver its full benefits.

I know a set of twins, a boy and a girl, who are so completely different that I didn’t realize they had the same parents or that they were even twins. She is kind, funny, and generous, while he is rough, blunt, and more selfish. They even look entirely different, she is tall and skinny and he is shorter and much stockier.
This is true for most siblings, and I believe that birth order and age differences have an effect on how we, as parents, treat them as they are growing up–think middle-child syndrome. Older parents tend to baby their children less. More experienced parents have an easier time raising their second and third child, and have an easier time letting them test their freedom. It amazes me every single day how completely opposite my children are in so many ways, I guess it is a good thing that they are so different, but one is a giver and the other is a taker.
I have a daughter and a son, ages 12 and 9, consecutively. My daughter was born breach and a few weeks prematurely. Because she was our first and was so small and fragile when she was born, she was coddled throughout her infancy. She refused to sleep through the night. As she grew older she became even more of a princess. She would throw temper tantrums and would cry for hours if she didn’t get her way. She was a girly girl who loved to play dress-up. She played with dolls for hours on end, and still does at times. She has always hated to read and has a stubborn streak a mile long, and refuses to say please or thank you. As she has gotten older, she feels that she is entitled to certain things, and that her brother is not. And, she acts so differently with her father than she does with me. But, she is tall and skinny and absolutely beautiful. She is smart and funny and shows her love by doing little unexpected things like making cards or drawing pictures.
My son is sweet, generous, and loving. He was not born early or breach or with the help of an epidural, and in fact was a healthy weight at birth. He immediately slept through the night and only cried when he was hungry, rarely throwing a temper tantrum. He is all boy and plays fairly rough, yet he is also gentle. When his sister hits him, scratches him, or says something mean to him, he just takes it and will go off into his room to work through it. It doesn’t even occur to him to fight back. He is happy-go-lucky most of the time and doesn’t let many things bother him. He loves school, loves to read, completes his homework as soon as he gets home, and acts the same way with his father as he does with me. As he has gotten older, he has stayed sweet, generous, loving, and polite, even sharing toys and candy with his sister when he knows that she will not reciprocate. He loves to hug. He is smart and funny and loves to try new things.
I know that the way my children behave is partly my fault, and the fault of their father, and partly just their own innate personality–nature versus nurture, and all that. The funny thing is, that when my daughter is at school or over at a friend’s house she is kind, sweet, and polite. Her teachers describe her as quiet and helpful. I guess these are signs that we are doing our job.
I love both of my children to the moon and back, and would not change either one of them. They are unique people who are becoming independent and intelligent young adults and I am grateful for them and for the experiences I have had, and will continue to have, raising them. There is always give and take in any relationship and in any person. And I can see that they are both givers and both takers, just like the rest of us.

I don’t get why a lot of foreigners fear us like we have Ebola or something. I mean, not all of us are terrorists. Not all of us are blood-sucking monsters. Not all of us have a restless desire to kill. There are a lot of wonderful Arabs out there.
Oh, and one more thing: not all of us belong to one religion. We consist of muslims, christians and others as well.
Some foreigners tend to have the idea that because a person is Arab, then that person is muslim. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying being muslim is bad or anything but I am Christian. I’m a 16-year-old Lebanese Christian girl. And I’m proud of it.
Lebanon, like any other country, has it’s bad sides, a lot of them even, but all in all, it is a wonderful country. We are a mixed country. We vary between Christians and Muslims. And we learn to get along. Let me ask you this question: do you fear muslims and Arabs because of a not-gonna-last terrorist group? Trust me, terrorist groups always get weakened and back away and a lot of muslims are actually wonderful human beings.
My point is, do not fear me, or my family, or friends, or my Lebanese people, simply because some utterly inhumane group of people decided to ruin the image of Arabs. A lot of us come in peace, and we mean no harm. So, please, change your perspectives.

Say what you will about the difference between the two towns, we look at it as a new adventure and hey, the house we bought has a stocked pond 5 blocks from it...not a bad option for bass. On to more important things, road trip with the dog and I will be the first week of Oct. and I've decided to go through Bozeman down to Denver vs. Boise and Salt Lake. Seeking advice on my approach, plan to fish the Madison/ Gibbon 1 day to chuck streamers for browns and the other day I've narrowed it down to either the Gallatin near Big Sky or the Lamar near Soda Butte Creek. Last morning may be on the Shoshone on the way down to Denver. So for you Montana junkies, any suggestions on what I should hit? Have fished the Missoula area so will bypass it as I only have a few days to fish. Will be wading and have a dog with who will have to stay in the car so no big hikes for all day fishing. Also, will have my road and mountain bikes on the back of car and while I'm not too worried about them getting messed with, they aren't cheap and would like the piece of mind if someone mentioned...don't park here or there. At the end of the day, looking forward to fishing the Bozeman and Yellowstone areas and any advice is appreciated.As I’m back from The City of Lights and Popcorn is dying to have some of mommy’s attention [literally putting her paws on my keyboard all the time], I still have lots of Parisian posts to share with you. First off, is this outfit from Esprit, which I wore on my second day of Paris Fashion Week. As some of you might know, I’m a proud ambassador of Esprit and am loving their #ImPerfect campaign. 💥 The #ImPerfect campaign promotes taking all of our big and small imperfections that we focus on negatively, and instead use those imperfections to stand out and be memorable. The key message is to freely be YOU and have fun with everything you have and don’t focus on it being ‘not perfect’. For instance, if you’re not a good dancer, don’t worry! Just be comfortable and confident with how you dance, because your imperfect dance moves are what make you oh-so pretty and perfect. Isn’t that a cool motto? I love it! I got this berry ensemble I’m wearing today from Esprit’s fall collection and I fell in love with the delicacy of the colors and fabrics. To be honest, the top has a more pinkish berry color to it, but hej, I’m rocking the combination with the slightly darker red skirt anyway. Plus: those imperfections make it absolutely perfect to me! What do you think?

Palazzo Abatellis is located in the Kalsa quarter. It is home to the Gallery Regional of Sicily, the Gallery of Art for the Sicilian region.
The palazzo was designed in the 15th century by Matteo Carnelivari. It was the residence of Francesco Abatellis (or Patella), port master of the Kingdom of Sicily, after the death of Abatellis it was given to a female monastery.
The regional gallery is home to numerous works of fine art, many of which acquired when several religious orders were suppressed in 1866.
The ground floor contains 12th century wooden works, 14th and 15th century works including some by Antonello Gagini, painted maiolica from the 14th-17th centuries and painted panels of wooden ceilings. The large frescoe of the Triumph of Death is exhibited in the former chapel.
On the first floor is the museum's most famous work, the Virgin Annunciate, by Antonello da Messina (15th century), considered among Italy's best Renaissance paintings.

An immunocytochemical study
Am J Pathol 146(4): 848-60
Expression of cathepsin (cat) S, a lysosomal cysteine protease, has recently been shown to cause an increase in production of amyloid beta-peptides in transfected human cells. In this study, we examined the presence and localization of cat S by immunocytochemistry in 21 control, 24 Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 10 Down syndrome (DS) postmortem brains. An antiserum to a human cat S fusion protein was affinity purified and its specificity confirmed by abolition of immunoreactivity after adsorption with cat S but not cat L fusion protein. A small minority of control cases showed light, focal staining of scattered cortical neurons. Many control cases, as well as most AD and DS cases, showed prominent staining of vascular smooth muscle cells, particularly in leptomeningeal vessels. Both AD and DS brain tissue showed increased immunoreactivity in a subset of neocortical and hippocampal neurons and glia. Cat S immunoreactivity occurred in a granular, cytoplasmic pattern in some neurons or in a more dense staining pattern in certain neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons. Cat S-positive neurons were also present in amygdala and basal forebrain in AD brains. A subset of astrocytes were immunoreactive with the cat S antibody in AD and DS but not in control brains. In rare AD cases, cat S immunostaining was observed in astrocytes in the periphery of amyloid-beta-containing plaques. These results suggest that cat S is up-regulated in AD and DS brain. The association of cat S immunoreactivity with tangle-bearing neurons, astrocytes, and rare senile plaques implies a role for altered cat S activity in the pathogenesis of AD.If you’re shopping for a tractor, if you’ve never owned a tractor before, and if you’re reading the pages of Homestead.org, then I’m going to assume that you’re in the market of a pretty cheap tractor; a VERY used tractor.
This is not such a bad position to be in, because unlike when you’re looking to purchase a car, the mere fact that the tractor you buy may be older than you are doesn’t automatically mean that you’ll wind up with either a museum piece or a pile of junk.
Tractors are tools. They’re built like tools, and the older they are, the more so. In this age when you have to buy a whole box of screws at your hardware store, just to get the one you want, you can still buy just the tractor parts that you need rather than a whole assembly or worse yet, the dreaded rebuild kit. Not only that, but in my state, you don’t even have to pay sales tax on tractor parts.
In fact, you’ll find that as often as not, quite a few of your tractor repair parts might even be considered cheap. After all, they’ve been making head-bolts for your 9N for the last 58 years. If you harbor a few vague notions about how the internal combustion engine works, you can probably fix your tractor yourself with simple hand tools.
Try that with a new car.
Probably the preeminent cheap-and-easy-to-repair older tractor is the Ford 9N-2N-8N series (see top of the page photo) but you can also still find parts readily available for other older-model domestic makes such as Case, International-Harvester, Massey-Ferguson, John Deere, Oliver and Allis-Chalmers, although you’ll probably be dealing with differently-named companies. (John Deere is the only one of those mentioned doing business under the same name.)
So relax, you don’t have to be a mechanical engineer to buy a used tractor, you just need to know what you want to do with your new-old machine and look for a few particular things.. In the center of this linkage is a power-take-off or PTO, which is a rotating shaft that connects to and drives such attachments as a mower or tiller.
The first three-point hitch was introduced on the Ford 9N in 1939, so you’ll find plenty of old tractors so equipped to choose from. While there are still tractors sold that don’t have hydraulics, notably the older Farmalls and John Deeres, these are mostly used as glorified lawn mowers. You get so much more functionality with the three-point hitch system that you really shouldn’t consider anything that doesn’t have one.
The next thing to assess when buying an older tractor is the age of the machine. This isn’t as easy to determine as one might suppose. First of all, most tractors look pretty much the same from one year to another and have only seen distinct model changes every decade or so, if that often. The best way to determine the exact age in years is to find the serial number of the tractor you’re interested in, and look it up on the internet. You’ll find no shortage of web sites listing dates of manufacture by serial number for all the major makes, but a good place to start is the Yesterday’s Tractors Registry online.
Looking up the year of manufacture may not be convenient or practical if you’ve just found a tractor that otherwise looks very interesting at a dealer or auction, so you may want to cross your fingers and hope that the current owner has the correct information.
Besides the date of manufacture gives you an indication as to what technology the tractor in question has, but it doesn’t tell you much about the amount of use it’s seen in it’s lifetime. That’s why it’s nice if the machine you’re looking at has a working tachometer with an hour-meter. An hour meter is also pretty handy to have when calculating your service intervals, but the chances are the machine in question won’t have one, or if it does, that it won’t be working. So you’ll need to make an educated guess.
A good way to do this is to examine the metal foot pedals, which are likely to have originally had a tread, grid or some sort of design that will now be showing wear. If these are inconclusive then a more important criteria would be the overall condition of the machine. Oil leaks and lots of play in the steering and pedal travel are not good signs.
Of course you also need to remember that quite possibly someone has gone to some trouble to make the tractor appear newer than it is with a paint job. That in itself is no bad thing since it amounts to protecting your soon-to-be investment, but if the tractor you’re looking at has shiny new paint, you should try to imagine what it looked like before. Also, while professionals will tell you that a re-paint can actually be harder and more durable than the original, don’t count on it. That shine may be chipping or peeling within a year, so while a new paint job has its benefits, once it’s been applied, it’s hard to tell how long it will last.
When you’re buying a pretty low-priced tractor, don’t forget that replacing a set of tires may cost you $400 to $800, so look at the tires carefully. Just because they have a lot of tread doesn’t mean that they’ll last a long time if they are severely weather-cracked, or if they have deep cuts. In fact, it’s not a bad idea to assume that you’ll be wanting a new set of tires early on and bear that in mind when setting your budget.
Next, you want to start up the engine. I’m assuming that you wouldn’t be reading this if you were an expert at engine diagnosis, and I’m not one either, but I can tell you some basic things to watch for that don’t take a lot of knowledge.
First of all, does it start right up? If not, it’s only going to be worse once you get it home, especially after the weather turns colder. An engine can be in pretty poor condition and still start easily in warm weather, likewise, just because it doesn’t start easily doesn’t mean that it’s worn out, but if you have any reason to believe the seller is has more mechanical capabilities than yourself, hard starting should be viewed with suspicion. There are always lots of tractors on the market. For our purposes here, if getting the engine started in the first place requires any special skills or procedures, just move on to the next one.
Assuming it turns over quickly and fires right up, does it idle smoothly and is there any excessive smoking from the exhaust? Again, either condition is not a sure sign of trouble, but since we’re not mechanics, maybe we’ll want to pass on anything that looks questionable.
Also, don’t forget to look for are oil leaks, which can come from simply not having a bolt tightened enough or something more sinister like main bearings about to fail. If the tractor has been recently cleaned or repainted, this might be harder to determine, so leaving it to idle for a while might not be a bad idea.
Generally speaking, you can’t expect to pay a really low price and not have a few things wrong with the tractor, but like many things, if you’ll investigate four or five in your price range, you’ll probably see one that stands above the rest.
The best way to assure that you’ve found at least a fair deal is to be familiar with the market and that’s a lot easier than it used to be. Once you’ve decided on the make and model you want to buy, I recommend you spend a few hours looking over the selection at TractorHouse.com. You’ll find several examples of most any popular model you want to consider, and you can compare the prices and conditions there until you’re a near-expert. You may even find the tractor you’re looking for within a reasonable distance of your home.
You can also find a selection of used attachments there.
Things may be different in your area, but In my neck of the woods, where the vegetation is lush and the rains are frequent, most everyone who buys a small tractor usually also purchases a brush-cutter of some kind, and a grading blade of some kind. I’d like to say a word about these.
First, the brush-cutter, what’s generically called a bush-hog. For $500-or $600 you can get a new brush-cutter made with a sheet metal body. Don’t buy one of these unless all you really want is to mow grass (in which case you’re better off with a finish mower). Real bush-hogging requires something with heavy steel plate, like the brand-name Bush-hog cutters, if you’re looking for equipment that will last more than a season or two. These cost more in the neighborhood of $1500 and up new, but since they’ll last for decades, you’re better off buying a used one than a new model of the lighter version.
As for grading blades, a straight blade does a poor job of most of the things you want to do with a blade. If you want to smooth your driveway, a box-blade is much, much more effective. Even a rock-rake does a better job of smoothing roads than a straight blade (although the straight blade will do a barely-adequate job if you turn it around backwards).
Straight blades are probably best for moving snow, but if you want to grade or move rocks, you’re better off with either a box blade or a rock rake.
A very good companion piece to a tractor is a utility trailer that you can haul it on. Besides giving you the capacity to attempt jobs at a distance from your home, a trailer is the only practical and affordable way to get your machine to the shop should that be required.
Finally, safety should be a major concern when you’re shopping for an older tractor. Even a small tractor can kill you if you wind up under it or entangled in the PTO, and roll-over protection and PTO guards were virtually unheard of prior to the 1970’s. Many of the older tractors have the row-crop or tricycle configuration which is just simply not as stable no matter what anyone tells you. I’d avoid these. Most tractors, even the older models, have wheels and axles that will allow you to widen the tread and this an important safety feature that you should have.
Don’t kid yourself that you’ll be able to jump clear of an overturning tractor.
When you get your new-to-you tractor home, always remember to avoid driving along the edge of streams or ditches that can undercut their banks and if you’re not certain that you can drive across a side-hill safely drive up and down it perpendicular to the slope.
If you’re pulling anything with a chain or nylon strap attached to the tractor, connect the chain to the draw-bar or something else as low to the ground as possible, so as to avoid turning the machine over backwards.
When you’re mowing near overhanging tree branches, have your wits about you, as a stout limb can sweep you off of the seat and into the path of the mower.

We find that a judicious choice of local measures, based either on the network's connectivity at a microscopic scale or on its community structure at a mesoscopic scale, compares favorably to global measures, such as betweenness centrality, in terms of efficiency, practicality and robustness. We also develop an analytical framework that highlights a transition in the characteristic scale of different epidemic regimes. This allows to decide which local measure should govern immunization in a given scenario.
Introduction
Epidemics never occur randomly. Instead, they follow the structured pathways formed by the interactions and connections of the host population1,2. The spreading processes relevant to our everyday life take place on networks of all sorts: social (e.g. epidemics3,4), technological (e.g. computer viruses5,6) or ecological (cascading extinctions in food webs7). With a network representation, these completely different processes can be modelled as the propagation of a given agent on a set of nodes (the population) and links (the interactions). Different systems imply networks with different organizations, just as different agents require different epidemic models.
There has long been significant interest in identifying the influential spreaders in networks. Which nodes should be the target of immunization efforts in order to optimally protect the network against epidemics? Unfortunately, most studies feature two significant shortcomings. Firstly, the proposed methods are often based on optimization or heuristic algorithms requiring nearly perfect information on a static system8,9; this is rarely the case. Secondly, methods are usually tested on small numbers of real systems using a particular epidemic scenario10,11; this limits the scope of possible outcomes.
We first present a numerical study, perhaps the largest of its kind to date, where we argue that, depending on the nature of the network and of the disease, different immunization tactics have to be taken into consideration. In so doing, we formalize the notion of node influence and illustrate how local knowledge around a particular node is usually sufficient to estimate its role in an epidemic. We also show how, in certain cases, the influence of a node is not necessarily dictated by its number of connections, but rather by its role in the network's community structure (see Fig. 1). Far from trivial, it follows that an efficient immunization strategy can be obtained solely from local measures, which are easily estimated in practice and robust to noisy or incomplete information. We further develop an analytical formalism ideally suited to test the effects of local immunization on realistic network structures. Combining the insights gathered from the numerical study and this formalism, we finally formulate a readily applicable approach which can easily be implemented in practice.
Results
Models and measures
There exist two standard models emulating diverse types of epidemics: the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) and susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) dynamics. In both, an infectious node has a given probability of eventually infecting each of its susceptible neighbors during its infectious period, which is terminated by either death/immunity leading to the recovered state (SIR) or by returning to a susceptible state (SIS). In the SIR dynamics, for a given transmission probability T, the quantity of interest is the mean fraction Rf of recovered nodes once a disease, not subject to a stochastic extinction, has finished spreading (i.e. we focus on the giant component12). Since each edge can only be followed once, this dynamics investigates how a population is vulnerable to the invasion of a new pathogen. In the SIS dynamics, we are interested in the prevalence I* (fraction of infectious nodes) of the disease at equilibrium (equal amounts of infections and recoveries) as a function of the ratio λ = α/β of infection rate α and recovery rate β. This particular dynamics permits the study of how a given network structure can sustain an already established epidemic.
Should a fraction ε of the population be fully immunized, our objective is to identify the nodes whose absence would minimize Rf and I*. The epidemic influence of a node — that is the effect of its removal on Rf and I* — depends mainly on its role in the organization of the network. Hence to efficiently immunize a population, we must first understand its underlying structure.
Network organization can be characterized on different scales, each of which affect the dynamics of propagation. At the microscopic level, the most significant feature is the degree of a node (its number of links, noted k) which in turn defines the degree distribution of the network. The significance of the high-degree nodes (the hubs) for network structure in general13, for network robustness to random failure14 and for epidemic control15 has long been recognized.
At the macroscopic level, the role of a node can be described by its centrality, which may be defined in various ways. Frequently used in the social sciences is the betweenness centrality (b), quantifying the contributions of a given node to the shortest paths between every pair of nodes in the network16. Arguably, this method should be among the best estimate of a node's epidemic influence as it directly measures its role in the different pathways between all other individuals17, yet at a considerable computational cost. A simpler method, the k-core (or k-shell) decomposition18,19, assigns nodes to different layers (or coreness c) effectively defining the core and periphery of a network (high and low c respectively). It has recently been shown that coreness is well suited to identify nodes that are the most at risk of being infected during the course of an epidemic20. In light of our results, we will be able to discuss the distinction between a node's vulnerability to infection and its influence on the outcome of an epidemic.
The mesoscopic scale has recently been the subject of considerable attention. At this level of organization, the focus is on the redundancy of connections forming dense clusters referred to as the community structure of the network21,22. Nodes can be distinguished by their membership number m, i.e., the number of communities to which they belong. We will consider that two links of a given node are part of one community if the neighbours they reach lead to significantly overlapping neighbourhoods21. This definition is directly relevant to epidemic dynamics as links within communities do not lead to new potential infections. We call structural hubs the nodes connecting the largest number of different communities. These nodes act as bridges facilitating the propagation of the disease from one dense cluster to another. Targeting structural hubs to hinder propagation in structured populations has been previously proposed and investigated10,11, but has yet to be tested extensively.
Note that the microscopic and mesoscopic levels (as defined above) are characterized by local measures in the sense that they do not require a complete knowledge of the network, in contrast to global measures like the betweenness centrality. Moreover, as we will see, local measures are less sensitive to incomplete or incorrect information. Adding, removing or rewiring a link only affects the degree or membership of nodes directly in the neighbourhood of the modification; whereas the same alterations can potentially affect the centrality of nodes anywhere in the network through cascading effects. Furthermore, even if community detection often requires the tuning of a global resolution parameter, we will see that this additional step does not affect the identification of structural hubs, meaning that local information is sufficient to accurately determine a node's memberships.
In our numerical simulations we will have a perfect knowledge of static networks. This will allow us to use global measures as a reference to test the efficiency of local measures best suited in practice. We therefore ask without discrimination: which of the degree k, the coreness c, the betweenness centrality b or the membership number m is the best identifier of the most influential nodes on the outcome of an epidemic? To answer this question, we have simulated SIR and SIS dynamics with Monte Carlo calculations on 17 real-world networks. In each case, a fraction ε of the nodes was removed in decreasing order of the nodes' score for each of the four different measures. By comparing their efficiency to reduce Rf or I* as a function of ε, we are able to establish which measure is best suited for a given scenario characterized by a network structure, a propagation dynamics and a disease transmissibility (i.e. probability of transmission).
Case study: a data exchange network
We first illustrate our methods using the network of users of the Pretty-Good-Privacy algorithm for secure information interchange (hereafter, the PGP network)23, which could be the host of the propagation of computer viruses, rumors or viral marketing campaigns. Results for the 16 other networks are presented and discussed in the next section as well as in the Supporting Information (SI) document.
Communities in the network are extracted with the link community algorithm of Ahn et al.21. This algorithm groups links — and therefore the nodes they join — into communities based on the overlap of their respective neighbouring nodes. It is this overlap that reduces the number of new potential infections in a community structure, as opposed to a random network. This method thus reflects our understanding of how communities affect disease propagation. While it may not directly detect the social groups or functional modules of a network, it identifies significant clusters of redundant links. This redundancy or overlap is quantified through a Jaccard coefficient, and two links are grouped into the same community when their coefficient exceeds a certain threshold. The threshold value acts as a resolution, enabling to look at different levels of organization. As suggested21, the value of the threshold is chosen to maximize the average density ρ of the communities (see Methods). As this choice may seem arbitrary, Fig. 2 investigates the similarity between the nodes with the highest membership numbers, for different thresholds. It suggests that the membership number is fairly robust around the threshold. Moreover, Fig. 2 also demonstrates that the effect of the removal of the structural hubs on a SIS epidemics is very robust to the choice of the threshold. Thus, we will henceforth use the membership numbers obtained with the threshold value corresponding to the highest community density.
(top) Community density (ρ) obtained through different Jaccard thresholds. (middle) Robustness of the structural hubs identification methods. Element (i,j) gives the overlap (normalized) between the structural hubs (top 1%) selected with thresholds i and j. The highest line and last column of the matrix correspond to the case where the membership number equals the degree. (bottom) Prevalence I* of SIS epidemics with λ = 5 when the top 1% of structural hubs are removed (compared with the results without removal in blue or with random targets in orange).
The differences, if any, between the efficiency of the different methods are due to the immunized nodes not being the same. Figure 3 (top) investigates the correlations between the different properties (k, b, c and m) of each node. Perhaps the most important result here is that nodes with a high membership number may have relatively small degree, coreness and betweenness centrality. Hence, we expect the immunizing method based on community structure to have a different influence on the outcome of epidemics. Figure 3 (bottom) shows the consistensy (or lack thereof) of a given measure, depending on the quality of the available data. The robustness of local (micro and meso) measures is of obvious practical advantage. Both robustness and correlations are further investigated in the SI.
(top) We present correlations between the degree (k, right axis), the coreness (c, left axis), the betweenness centrality (b, vertical axis) and the membership number (m, color) for each nodes. Each measure is normalized according to the highest value found in the network. Each node is represented in this 4-dimensional space and a simple triangulation procedure then yields a more intelligible appearance. Structural hubs (dark red) can be found even at relatively small degree (~ kmax/2), coreness (~ cmax/5) and centrality (~ bmax/3). (bottom) Jaccard coefficient between the ensemble of nodes identified as part of the top 20% according to a given measure (k, m or b) on two versions of the network: the original complete network and a network ensemble where a certain percentage of links has been randomly removed (horizontal axis). The shorter the range of a measure, the more robust it is to incomplete information.
To study various epidemic scenarios, we consider both SIS and SIR dynamics (which may behave quite differently) with different values of the transmission probability (λ and T for SIS and SIR, respectively). In fact, each network features an epidemic threshold, i.e. critical values λc24 and Tc25, below which I* and Rf vanish to zero in an equivalent infinite network ensemble. As we will show, the observed behavior can differ significantly depending whether or not λ and T are close to their critical value.
Figure 4 presents results of different immunization methods against SIS dynamics for different values of λ. On the top figure, where λ is near λc, the most successful method of intervention is to target nodes according to their degree. At low transmissibility, the disease follows only a very small fraction of all links. The shortest paths are seldom used and the poor performance of betweenness centrality follows. Moreover, the disease will not be affected by the community structure, because even in dense neighbourhoods, most links will not be travelled. We then say that the disease, unaffected by link clustering, follows a tree-like structure (without loops), where community memberships are insignificant. It is therefore better to simply remove as many links as possible.
Nodes are removed in decreasing order of their score according to each method: coreness (green pentagons), degree (black circles), betweenness centrality (blue triangles) and memberships (red diamonds) and the effect of removal is then quantified in terms of the decrease of the prevalence I*. The prevalence of the epidemics when the removed nodes are chosen at random (grey squares) has been added for comparison. Figures are presented in increasing order of transmissibility (λ) from top to bottom.
As λ increases beyond λc, we see that immunization based on membership numbers quickly outperforms the other methods. As more links are travelled, the disease is more likely to follow superfluous links in already infected communities. Hubs sharing their many links within few communities are therefore not as efficient in causing secondary infections as one might expect. Similarly, targeting through betweenness centrality also performs better with higher λ, albeit not as well as membership-targeting in this case. For λ ≫ λc, immunization based on membership numbers (local) and on betweenness centrality (global) converge toward similar efficiency, significantly outperforming degree-based immunization.
Another interesting feature of our results is the poor performance of immunization based on node coreness. A previous study had clearly shown that epidemics mostly flourished within the core of the network (see Fig. 5) because of its density20. Ironically, this density also implies redundancy. While the core nodes are highly at risk of being infected, their removal has a limited effect because there exist alternative paths within their neighbourhood: the core offers a perfect environment to the disease and is consequently robust to node removal. It is therefore more effective to stop the disease from reaching, or leaving, the core by removing the nodes bridging other neighbourhoods (i.e. the structural hubs).
Representation (based on26) of the k-shells in the PGP network with nodes colored according to their total infectious period during a given time interval. Red nodes are more likely to be infectious at any given time than green nodes as the color is given by the square of the fraction of time spent in infectious state. Note how the central nodes (the core) of the network are most at risk.
Similar conclusions are drawn for the SIR dynamics. As T moves away from Tc, the most significant level of organisation shifts from the degree (microscopic) to communities (mesoscopic) as membership-based immunization progressively outperforms the other strategies.
Results on networks of diverse nature
In this section, we highlight different behaviours observed in social, technological and communication networks using 7 other datasets (full results for the 17 datasets are available in the SI): subset of the World Wide Web (WWW)13, MathSciNet co-authorship network (MathSci)27, Western States Power Grid of the United States (Power Grid)28, Internet Movie Database since 2000 (IMDb)29, cond-mat arXiv co-authorship network (arXiv)22, e-mail interchanges between members of the University Rovira i Virgili (Email)30 and Gnutella peer-to-peer network (Gnutella)31.
The results for the WWW, MathSci and IMDb networks further support our previous conclusions, with the exception that membership-based immunization performs surprisingly better than the degree-based variant even near the epidemic threshold of the network (see WWW and MathSci). The betweenness-centrality-based immunization was not tested on IMDb because of computational constraints (its computation required over 800 hours with our available ressources and a standard algorithm32), which illustrates a significant limit of this measure. Approximations could have been used33, but the intricate (and mostly unknown) relationship between the efficiency of the measure and the accuracy of the approximation would have only caused additional uncertainties.
The results presented for the Power Grid network illustrate a fundamental difference between the SIS and the SIR dynamics: while we are interested in the fraction of the network sustaining an established epidemic in SIS, it is the fraction of nodes invaded by a new disease that is relevant in SIR. In fact, the structure of the Power Grid, a chain of small, easily disconnected modules, enhances the qualitative discrepancy between the epidemic influence of nodes subjected to these two dynamics. For the SIS dynamics, the membership-based intervention is the most efficient because it weakens all modules, limiting the prevalence of the disease. In distinction, targeting through betweenness centrality merely separates the modules, so that they indiviually remain infected. For the SIR dynamics, separating the modules is the best approach as it directly stops the infection from spreading; while weakened – but connected – modules still provide pathways. This effect is a direct consequence of the particular structure of the Power Grid and is insignificant on other networks.
Finally, the last set of results, on arXiv, Email and Gnutella, present the effect of the community density ρ on the performance of membership-based immunization. For very small ρ, the paths within communities do not qualitatively differ from the links bridging neighborhoods in their effect on the disease propagation. This targeting method is therefore expected to converge toward degree-based immunization if m and k are strongly correlated. However, as most tested networks had fairly dense communities, ρ ≥ 0.3, the relevance of memberships should not be understated.
Investigation of the epidemic regimes transition
The results of the previous sections suggest that local information (i.e., degree, membership) is often sufficient for a nearly optimal global immunization. More precisely, we found these two methods to outperform or to be as efficient as the betweenness centrality (the global method used for comparison) in 62 of the 68 studied scenarios (i.e., 17 networks / 2 dynamics / 2 transmissibility regimes). This implies that membership (e.g., on PGP), degree (e.g., Gnutella) or both (e.g. MathSci) lead to an immunization at least as efficient as global methods while having the noteworthy advantage of requiring much less information and of being less sensitive to incomplete information. This section focuses on the conditions guiding the choice between the degree-based or the membership-based immunization strategy. In this respect, Figs. 4 and 6 provide a useful hindsight: the membership-based strategy is more efficient than the degree-based one when transmissibility is high and/or when communities are dense. To further our understanding and test this hypothesis, we introduce a random network model featuring a community structure, and exactly solve its final state (Rf) under SIR dynamics using generating functions.
Nodes are removed in decreasing order of their score according to each method: coreness (green pentagons), degree (black circles), betweenness centrality (blue triangles) and memberships (red diamonds) to measure efficiency by the decrease of I* or Rf. The size of the epidemics for random removal of nodes (gray squares) is added for comparison. Error bars have been omitted for clarity of the SIR results on the Power Grid, but are shown in the SI.
Our model is a slightly modified version of the configuration model12,34 where nodes are connected either through single links or through motifs (see Fig. 7 for an example). Motifs are used to simulate the effect of a community structure, that is the redundancy of the neighbourhoods of nodes. Our motifs are composed of M nodes, all connected to each other, and a node belongs to i motifs and has j single links with probability p(i,j). This node therefore has a degree (k) equal to (M − 1)i + j and a membership (m) equal to i + j. Networks are generated using a stub pairing scheme: a node belonging to i motifs and having j single links has i “motif stubs” and j “link stubs”. Groups and single links are then formed by randomly choosing M motif stubs and 2 link stubs, respectively, and then by linking the corresponding nodes to one another. This last step is repeated until none of the motif and link stubs remains. The distribution
therefore defines a maximally random network ensemble, and the results obtained are averaged over this ensemble.
Extending previous work35, we compute the expected value of Rf for the network ensemble just defined where nodes and links are randomly removed to simulate immunization and disease transmission (SIR dynamics), respectively. Full details are given in the SI. Using typical values for {p(i,j)}, our model illustrates and confirms our hypothesis by clearly showing in Fig. 8a transition of efficiency between the degree-based and the membership-based immunization strategy. Initially less efficient when the transmissibility is low (i.e., higher threshold, lower value of Rf), membership progressively outperforms degree as the transmissibility increases. As mentionned above, for lower values of T, the best option is therefore to immunize the hubs (high k) to shift the degree distribution towards lower degrees. For higher values of T, targeting structural hubs (high m) that act as bridges between “independent” neighbourhoods leads to a more efficient immunization as it reduces the number of paths between different regions of the network. Note that we do not explicitly model the effect of community density. This could have been done by letting links exist independently with a given probability η. This is however identical to letting the disease propagate with probability ηT. Thus, the value of T in Fig. 8 is related to the density of the communities, and our conclusions can therefore be extended to the cases of low/high community densities.
Final sizes of SIR epidemics after immunization of various fractions ε of nodes on synthetic networks with M = 4 and an heterogeneous degree distribution (details in SI). Near the epidemic threshold, targeting by degree (dotted curves) is the better choice whereas targeting by memberships (solid curve) should be preferred for higher transmissibility. Monte Carlo simulations were also performed to validate the formalism and indicated on the curves (the case ε = 0.05 is omitted not to clutter the graph) with circles (targeting by degree) and squares (targeting by membership).
Discussion
One of the main contributions of this work is to offer a formal definition of the epidemic influence of nodes, i.e. the effect of its removal on I* of Rf, which is open to diverse methods of approximation. Our results confirm that standard measures such as the degree or betweenness centrality are not always the best indicators of a node's influence. Moreover, we have highlighted that the coreness, which has recently been proposed as an indicator of nodes' influence20, offers poor performances. This has brought us to distinguish between individual risk and global influence. We have also illustrated how a universal approach is still wanting, since different networks and different diseases require different methods of intervention.
Consequently, the fact that the numbers of links and/or communities to which a node belongs are excellent measure of its epidemic influence — at times better, at times equivalent, but never much worse than global centrality measures — is a particularly important result. The fact that they both are local measures is especially relevant considering that we rarely have access to the exact network structure of a system, either because it is simply too large (WWW), too dynamic (email networks) or because the links themselves are ill-defined (social networks). Not only are local measures computable from a limited subset of a network (which is often the only available information), but a coarse-grained measure like membership is even more interesting as it is easier to estimate than a node's actual degree. For instance, consider how much simpler it is to enumerate your social groups (work, family, etc.) than the totality of your acquaintances.
Finally, the existence of a transition between two epidemic regimes with different characteristic scales may well be the single most important conclusion of this work. In the first regime, for low transmissibility and sparse communities, the microscopic structural features (i.e. node connectivity or degree) offer the most relevant information; while for higher transmissibility and denser communities, mesoscopic features (i.e node communities or membership) appear more relevant. We expect to see an equivalent transition between any pair of measures which oppose the micro and meso scales (e.g. different range-limited measures of centrality36).
Based on our empirical and analytical results, we thus propose a simple procedure on how to judge which local measure can be expected to yield the best results in a given situation. From the available subset of a given network:
Obtain the degree distribution to estimate the transmissibility of the disease in relation to the epidemic threshold λc24 or Tc25.
If easily transmissible (λ ≫ λc or T ≫ Tc), evaluate the network's community structure; otherwise, go to 4.
If the community density is high (
), immunize nodes according to their memberships; otherwise, go to 4.
For a transmissibility near the epidemic threshold, or for sparse communities (low ρ), immunize according to the degree of the nodes.
The analytical and numerical frameworks used in this work are expected to guide immunization efforts toward simpler, more precise and efficient strategies. Likewise, the introduction of a node influence classification scheme opens a new avenue for finding better local estimates of a node's role in the global state of its system.
Methods
Betweenness centrality
For all pairs (a,b) of nodes excluding i, list the na,b shortest paths between a and b. Let na,b(i) be the number of these paths containing i. The betweenness centrality bi of node i is then given by:
Coreness
The coreness of node i is the highest integer ci such that the node is part of the set of all nodes with at least ci links within the set.
Community detection
Two links, eij and eik, from a given node i, are said to belong to the same community if their Jaccard coefficient J(eij,eik) (similarity measure) is above a given threshold Jc:
where n+(u) is the set containing the neighbors of u including u.
Community density
The density ρi of a community i of ni > 2 nodes and di links is the proportion of the possible redundant links that do exist; i.e., the fraction of existing links excluding the minimal ni – 1 links that are needed for this community to be connected:
The community density ρ is then calculated according to
where D is the total number of links not belonging to single link communities, for which ρi = 021.
Immunization
To perform the immunization of a fraction ε of the network according to a certain measure Γ, we remove the εN nodes with the highest Γ. When a choice must be made (nodes with equal Γ), all decisions are taken randomly and individually for each simulated epidemics.
Monte Carlo simulations
To investigate the fraction of a network which can sustain an epidemics, SIS simulations start with all nodes in an infectious state and are then relaxed until an equilibrium is reached. To investigate the mean fraction of a network which a disease can invade, SIR simulations start with a single randomly chosen infectious node and run until there are no more infectious nodes. Results shown in the figures are obtained by averaging over the outcome of several numerical simulations until the minimal possible standard deviation (limited by network structure and finite size) is obtained. For the SIR dynamics, only the simulations leading to largescale epidemics (at least 1% of the nodes) were considered. The complete procedure is given in the SI.

Global efficiency of local immunization on complex networks:Nature Notes by Dr. Frank Lang
Nature Notes is a long time member of the Crater Lake Natural History Association Board of Directors. The non-profit Association provides funding to the park and Oregon Caves for interpretive programs through our sale of books and other items. A board benefit is an occasional outing provided by the park. In August, the board was privileged to spend the night on Crater Lake’s Wizard Island courtesy of the Park Service. While there, three big fat toads along the trail surprised Nature Notes as he stumbled down from Wizard Island’s crater in the deepening twilight.
Although it might be his imagination, Nature Notes thinks the western toad, Bufo boreas, was once more common. He remembers finding toads the size of dinner plates in and
among the sword ferns and goat’s beard in the garden of his childhood home. Well, maybe saucers. Great warty beasts that Papa always encouraged because of the damage they inflicted on his garden archenemy, the common slug. Those toads, however, did nothing to help in his constant battle with his other garden enemy, the neighbor’s cat.
Now the cane or marine toad is another story. This six inch long toad, native to the Rio Grand south, was introduced to Florida after several tries where they have become, well, pests, famous for their gustatorial habitat of cleaning up Fido’s and Kitty’s uneaten pet food. Cane toads are voracious omnivores. Although they aren’t big enough to eat a cat, they have the where-with-all to kill one. Like many amphibians, their skins are toxic, toxic enough to kill a curious dog or cat. The toxin is produced by their parotid glands, the large warts back of both eyes. After handling a cane toad, be sure to wash your hands. Fortunately for the State of Jefferson, cane toads are sensitive to cold, which makes their presence on Wizard Island unlikely, the specter of global warming not withstanding.
But back to Bufo boreas. Toads on Wizard Island were unexpected. How did they get there? What do they eat? Insects and other Arthropods? Slugs? Many questions. They probably over winter by crawling down in the spaces between the large clunky chunks of lava rock that makes going anywhere on Wizard Island, except on trails, difficult.
Nature Notes knows from childhood experience that handling toads can be a hazard, for the handler and the toad. Handler gets peed upon when an overexcited toad looses a precious supply of fluid laced with toxins manufactured by glands in their bladder similar to those in its paratoid glands. In a relatively dry environment, toad has a rehydration problem. The handler just gets wet, unless he licks his fingers.
Contrary to popular belief, handling toads will not give you warts, peed upon or not. Warts are cause by viruses not present in toads. While Googling around for this piece, Nature Notes was surprised to learn that a duct tape bandage on a wart causes it to disappear. Better than silk threads and stump water, he bets. And finally, Nature Notes wonders what might happen if a truly desperate princess kissed a Wizard Island toad.

Students in the Family Justice Clinic (“FJC”) focus on the impacts of criminal convictions on custody and visitation, parental rights, and debt related to child support. FJC faculty and students conduct trainings with public defenders on family consequences, advise criminal defendants on family-related issues, and represent family members of incarcerated parents in guardianship proceedings. This fall students are developing checklists to help public defenders identify family issues for their clients at intake and sentencing, and creating handouts on modification of child support for clients who will be serving time.
In spring 2015, FJC students will work directly with the Clark County Public Defender on mitigation and sentencing in cases involving family issues. The clinic will co-counsel with the special public defender on termination of parental rights cases involving prisoners. This partnership brings additional resources to families that face heightened challenges due to incarceration, and also exposes students to the nexus between the child welfare and criminal justice systems.
Additionally, each semester FJC students teach classes at the Clark County Detention Center to provide vital information to prisoners regarding family law consequences of imprisonment and how to protect their rights. To better understand the broad impact of criminalization in the Las Vegas region, the FJC has partnered with Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada to develop a comprehensive needs assessment survey of people with criminal convictions. This project will help identify the negative impacts of convictions on the community in an effort to develop better services and outreach.
Traditional legal practice has not always dealt well with the interrelated nature of legal problems—especially those faced by poor people. The goal of the Collateral Consequences Project is to develop attorneys who are equipped to address the multiple and punitive ways in which legal systems intersect in poor people’s lives.4 Stars
I spent the weekend in St. Michael’s, Maryland in a beautiful house overlooking the bay. Yay family! My aunt, the owner of the house, handed me a book as soon as I got there and said she read it in one sitting–she just couldn’t put it down. Now, this is a work-a-holic woman who spends most of her time in her office and on the phone during the week, and the rest of the time doing chores around her house, so when she recommended a book that she “couldn’t put down” I thought it would be a grand adventure.
The Road is an interesting bit of literature. It is the story of the end of the world as we know it, but it is told in a unique manner. The story revolves around a man (only known as “the man” or “Papa”) and his boy (only known as “the boy) who are traveling south in some unknown country after some unknown tragedy that ended civilization. The author does not go into detail about what caused the situation, nor does he expound upon the plight of the characters. It is a rather simple story of a hard journey to outrun the winter and find enough food to make it through the next day. The man and his son scavenge a desolate land where nothing is alive…no animals, no plants, just displaced people. As the story progresses, the reader gets a sense that the pivotal event took place several years before–just a few days before the boy was born, and death and destruction have continued since. The boy’s mother kills herself and the father goes on the run to avoid a little-known threat that is not explained and only seen twice throughout the story; both encounters end horrifically and violently.
I liked this story and I liked the author’s style. This really was a typical end-of-the-world, if-we-don’t-stop-we’ll-all-die type of warning book that has been popular for decades, but the author approached it in such a way as to make it much more terrifying and unsettling than any other I’ve read. He didn’t give detailed scenes; he didn’t explain the political or social causes of the horror; he didn’t even describe what was living and what wasn’t. Everything was just there, revealed to the reader as the two main characters experienced it, underscored with a definite message about the nature of living and what humans are capable of. The author used no quotation marks, which left the reader uncertain as to who was speaking or if it was a thought. This uncertainty put the reader on edge, and heightened the general horror of the story. The lack of detail allowed for the imagination to run wild, and the few detailed glimpses of actual horror just bolstered the imagination instead of dampening it.
I recommend this book as an emotionally moving piece. It sticks with you during the read and well after. I read it in one sitting, not only because it was good, but because I knew that I couldn’t put it down without knowing how the horror resolved itself.

See-It Sacks...
These fantastic clear drawstring sacks can store Lego, Blocks, hair ties and even toiletries. Yes, they are similar to the ones made by Ashley at Make It-Love It. We have a super-huge one with all the Duplo blocks in it, which gets shoved under the bed. After making the really big one, Husband thought it was a good idea, but too hard to hold open to throw the toys back into. Especially when there is a huge amount of lego on the floor! After sitting on this for a while, along came an epiphany... Stiffen the top fabric with that stiff woven interfacing. Magical stuff!!
Top stays open nicely...Well done me :)
Amelia received a My-Name Placemat for Christmas from us. I have adde a little cup circle, since my two boys are forever putting their drinks near their elbows and knocking them over. I wish I'd thought to do this earlier!! The butterfly fabric was a perfect choice, chosen by Amelia herself after I'd been on a bit of a search for 'butterflies'. You'd think they would be everywhere, but I just couldn't seem to find the right one for a while.
Mitchell has been waiting patiently for his placemat for a while, Mateo turned two a couple of days ago (Happy Birthday little guy)...no those two don't have the plastic on them yet, so they're not shiny!!
And a picture of Caitlin's placemat that she received for her third birthday, about six months ago. Along with a super cute hooded cape. I do have beautiful photos her talented Mum took in the park of her wearing it...I just can't find them...grrrr!!! When I do, I will be sure to update here.

The Rugby Channel November 2016 Live Broadcasts
The Rugby Channel Release by USA Rugby: November 2, 2016
LAFAYETTE, Colo. – This November, The Rugby Channel will broadcast an unprecedented 22 exclusive live matches from around the globe, including international tests featuring the USA Men’s and Women’s National Teams, traditional heavyweights England, the storied Barbarians and rising powers Japan and Argentina. Paying subscribers will be able to view the matches live and on-demand at or via The Rugby Channel’s apps for iOS, Android, Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire devices.
The feast of live coverage will begin on Friday, Nov. 4 at 8 pm ET when the USA Men’s Eagles open The Rugby Weekend Presented by AIG by playing host to the Maori All Blacks at Toyota Park in Bridgeview, Illinois. The Maori All Blacks, an elite side from New Zealand featuring players with Maori ‘whakapa,’ or genealogy, are returning to the U.S. for the first time since 2013, when they played the Eagles before a sellout crowd in Philadelphia.
Then on Saturday, Nov. 12, the Eagles will travel to Bucharest to play Romania in an 11 am ET kickoff. To wrap up their tour of Europe, the USA will face Tonga in San Sebastian, Spain on Saturday, Nov. 19 at 11 am ET.
The USA Women’s Eagles will head to France to play two test matches against fourth-ranked France, four months after competing against Les Blues in the second annual Women’s Rugby Super Series in Utah. Stade de la Méditerranée in Béziers will host the first matchup between the 2016 RBS Women’s 6 Nations champions and the U.S. on Tuesday, Nov. 22 at 6 pm ET, with the second match set for Altrad Stadium in Montpellier on Friday, Nov. 25 (kickoff time TBD).
“We are excited to unveil this action-packed November programming schedule for The Rugby Channel,” said David Sternberg, CEO of the channel’s parent company, Rugby International Marketing. “These exclusive matches from the U.S. and around the world should be massively appealing to both current and new subscribers to the service.”
The programming lineup includes a number of other top matches not involving the American national teams. Among these will be the Old Mutual Wealth Series of England autumn international tests from legendary Twickenham Stadium, with the Red and Whites hosting four opponents all ranked within the top 10 in the world. First on Saturday Nov. 12, No. 2 England will play No. 4 South Africa. England’s last victory against the Springboks came in 2006. Since then, England has failed to beat the Boks in 12 attempts.
On Saturday, Nov. 19, England will welcome No. 10 Fiji in a rematch of last year’s Rugby World Cup opener that saw England prevail 35-11. Fiji will be looking for its 1st ever win against England.
Then on Saturday, Nov. 26 England will host No. 9 Argentina for the first time since a 31-12 England victory in 2013. England will close out the autumn internationals on Saturday, Dec. 3 against world No. 3 Australia. England will welcome the Wallabies back to Twickenham for the first time since a painful loss to Australia in a crucial pool match during the 2015 Rugby World Cup.
All four England matches will kick off LIVE at 9:30 am ET and will air exclusively on The Rugby Channel in the United States.
Building on their success at last year’s Rugby World Cup in England, the Brave Blossoms from Japan will welcome world No. 9 Argentina in a home test match at Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium in Tokyo on Saturday, Nov. 5 at 1:40 am ET.
Also on Nov. 5, the legendary Barbarians FC will host South Africa for the first time since 2010. This Barbarians’ meeting with the Springboks takes place at the iconic Wembley Stadium in London at 11 am ET and will be the eighth time the two sides have met since 1952. The Barbarians will return to The Rugby Channel on Nov. 11 when they face Fiji at the Kingspan Stadium in Belfast at 2:30 pm ET.
In addition to these internationals, The Rugby Channel in November will bring its subscribers live Round 8 and 9 coverage of the Guinness Pro12, first- and second-round action from the Anglo-Welsh Cup, visits by the Maori All Blacks to top European clubs Munster and Harlequins, and coverage of the Green King IPA Championship. And as always, the service will feature the weekly news show TRC Report and on-demand access to the archives of USA Rugby, England Rugby and the Rugby World Cup.
The Rugby Channel provides rugby supporters in the U.S. and Canada with a unique digital platform where fans can watch some of the most elite competitions in the world. Subscriptions to The Rugby Channel are just $4.99 a month, or a yearly subscription can be purchased $49.99, less than a dollar a week for exclusive coverage of U.S. and international rugby.

Whilst I'm chuffed to be getting away for a few days, I'm always faced with the debacle of what to pack, and, more specifically, what makeup to pack. Because I'm only away for a few days, I had to streamline my beauty packing down to the basics (okay, perhaps a tad more than the bare necessities) and I thought I'd share the products that I settled on.
The base: I know this seems very excessive for a short trip but I've somehow justified it to myself. The Garnier Miracle Skin Cream is a moisturiser that just gives a very slight tint with barely any coverage, making it a great base for any foundation. In order to achieve a more even complexion I've found that mixing the Erborian CC Créme HD and the Erborian BB Créme gives a dewy finish with a good amount of coverage. Lastly the Collection Lasting Perfection Concealer generally comes with me on every trip - it's a super cheap product that gets the job done without any faff.
Complexion powders: To set everything in place I mostly reach for the Bourjois Healthy Balance Powder, it mattifies the t-zone without looking cakey and has really great lasting power. Sleek's Blush by Three in the shade Lace is ideal for holidays because it contains three different cheek shades that will go with most makeup looks, all in one nifty little palette! The Catrice Matt Bronzer is the bronzer I'm currently using. It's very warm toned and gives the impression of a sunkissed complexion, perfect for people like me, whose faces inexplicably refuse to tan. Lastly, theBalm Mary-Lou Manizer is my highlighter of choice. It's a great shimmery champagne highlight without a trace of glitter.
Eyes and brows: I think I managed to restrain myself fairly well here *pats self on back*. For brows I'm keeping it simple and sticking to the Maybelline Brow Drama tinted brow gel. I have fairly unruly brows that have a tendency to rebel and this keeps them in place all day. Thumbs up. In terms of eye shadow, I've packed MAC's Painterly Paint Pot as an eyeshadow base, it has a fantastic formula and keeps eyeshadow from creasing. The NARS St Paul de Vence Eyeshadow Duo will also be making an appearance on the trip. The two eyeshadow colours in this mini-palette are summery orange-tones that pair well with a bronzed face and a nude lip. My mascara choice is fairly predictable for me, Ive been using Benefit's They're Real! mascara for years now. It doesn't smudge, it holds a curl and it's almost waterproof - what's not to love?
Lips: Now this is where I'm very proud of my streamlining skills. When it comes to lip products my self restraint is close to nothing. I collect lipstick, lip balm and lipgloss like it's nobody's business and over the course of a month I'll end up with ten or so rattling around my handbag at once. Not ideal, I am aware. That's why I'm very pleased that I've whittled the choices down to just two. Firstly, the Chanel Coco Shine in Scénario. I picked this up recently in a sale and it seems to go with almost every makeup look. The other lipstick is MAC Velvet Teddy, a firm favourite of mine that is diminishing at an alarming pace and I will therefore be using it sparingly!
That's it for my travel makeup bag, I think I've been fairly reasonable in most categories and shan't need reinforcement when transporting my luggage. Now I just have to resist the temptation of chucking in another ten lip products before I leave!5 days until the open!!!

Got something to say? Go for it!Israel is proving to be a hot TV market.
It’s already provided the source material for such hits as Showtime’s “Homeland” — and, on Monday, spawned another TV project when ABC ordered a pilot script for “So Where Were We?,” which is based on an Israeli sitcom.
Described as a “cringe” comedy a la “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “So Where Were We?” follows a hapless man named Israel, who is constantly getting into trouble with his sharp tongue and his schemes.
And just as countries like the UK (“The Office,” “Shameless”) or Denmark (“The Killing,” “The Bridge”) have provided a stream of US TV adaptations before, Israel is the latest country to benefit from the industry’s globalization.
“In this golden age of television there’s so much demand for scripted content and ideas or formats that these producers and studios are really beating bushes around the world,” says Brad Adgate, senior VP of research at Horizon Media. It’s also a matter of success begetting success. “Homeland” (adapted from Israel’s “Prisoner of War”) has won six Emmys, including Best Drama Series. And HBO found a three-season hit in the Gabriel Byrne drama “In Treatment,” which was based on the Israeli series “BeTipul.”
“If you get a hot show like ‘Homeland’… producers will look at that and say, ‘Well, what else do they have over there?’ ” Adgate says. Other Israeli-to-US series have included the CBS thriller “Hostages,” which premiered weeks before the series of the same name on which it was based. CBS also announced that it was developing the medical drama “Only Human” starring Jamie Lee Curtis, which has roots in Israel.
This midseason will bring another Israel-to-US adaptation with NBC’s “Allegiance,” a CIA drama about Russian spies — a plot bearing more than a slight resemblance to FX’s popular “The Americans.”
“Israeli [dramas] tend to be a little more thought-provoking, with serialized, complex storylines,” says Adgate. “And those types of shows are really popular right now.”
Ratings success doesn’t hurt, either. “So Where Are We?” is the top-rated comedy on Israel’s Channel 10. The interactive singing competition “Rising Star” was also a hit in its native Israel, but the much-hyped US version aired this summer on ABC to tepid viewer interest.
Meanwhile, Keshet Media — the Israeli studio behind “Rising Star” — formed a joint venture with Dick Clark Productions — Keshet DCP — to sell its formats in the States.
Up next? A game show called “Boom!,” coming soon to Fox.Sometimes we get bombarded by so much marketing and sales information that we no longer have any idea of what truth is and what is a mere sales pitch. With this in mind I have decided to create a list of my personal favourite pool products. This list is not a list of products that have been scrutinised through a scientific process. These are simply products that I have owned or used. Products that my family and I have grown to love and would simply prefer to not live without.
Over time I will add more and more products. If you would like suggest a product or have a product that you would like me to test out simply contact me and we can take it from there.Findings:

AHHHHH.. I’M CRYING?? THAT’S SO COOL WTF
before i go to astronomy :’-) ✨
song i put on repeat:
(sorry for low quality pic, i don’t have my laptop with me right now)
- These dummies danced around each other for months before Aoyama got frustrated with the achingly slow build and made the first move. Bakugou will deny this one hundred percent, but the entire class knows. They were THERE.
-Aoyama loves surprising Bakugou with little gifts, even if it’s just a cool charm or matching keychains, because he always gets flustered no matter how small the gesture.
-One time Bakugou called Aoyama ‘Princess’ and that boy almost died from how red his face got.
-A scenario where Mineta calls Aoyama the f slur and Bakugou kicks that bitch like a football across the hallway. (Bonus points if Mineta calls Bakugou the f slur and days later Mineta is found stuffed inside a book bag in a locked locker with a laser hole straight through his grape hair.)
-Okay, Bakugou loves his boyfriend so much and you will never hear the end of it. Look at him. He’s fucking perfect. Have you seen his boyfriend? He’s such a good boy.
-Aoyama would be the same but every time he so much as mentions how great Bakugou is, Mina decks him directly in the throat. She had to suffer his relentless pining for EIGHT MONTHS before they got together. No longer.
-They’re the official classroom lovebirds and any anti’s are blocked from the group chat. And from real life. Tokoyami and Yao have started flinging the haters out the window.
-Speaking of the group chat!!
-Shouji has said one thing in the group chat, ever. It’s become the name of the group chat and anyone who tries to change it is shut down by Uraraka. “I didn’t think gay people existed until I saw Bakugou start crying because of how much he loves Aoyama.”
-“I WASN’T CRYING I HAD SOMETHING IN MY DAMN EYE YOU OCTOPUS LOOKING MOTHER FUCKER I’LL FIGHT YOU”
-When Bakugou discovered that Aoyama licks the icing off of frosted animal crackers and puts them back in the box, they got into their first ever couple fight. It ended with them never buying frosted animal crackers again.
-(“BAKUGOU YOU DON’T EVEN EAT THE ANIMAL CRACKERS HOP OFF MY DICK”
“LISTEN YOU BAGUETTE SPEAKING PRETTY BOY I DONT NEED TO EAT THE CRACKERS, THATS JUST W R O N G”)
-Sometimes, when it’s really late and Bakugou is still up studying (even though Aoyama told him to go to bed three hours ago), Aoyama sits up in bed and just SCREAMS until Bakugou at least lays down. He passes out immediately afterwards. It’s the most terrifying thing Bakugou has ever witnessed.
-“Who’s gayer, Aoyama or Bakugou?”
“Bakugou.”
“Bakugou.”
“Bakugou.”
“Tf??? Aoyama.”
“BAKUGOU.”
-Aizawa has a secret cork board behind his desk dedicated to Bakugou and Aoyama’s relationship. Any time one of the students takes a picture of them being cute, it’s put on the cork board. He thinks they make each other really happy, which makes him happy.
-Aoyama isn’t too fond of Bakugou’s fashion sense, but still wears his clothes sometimes because… he likes the thought. Aoyama Yuuga, wearing Katsuki’s favorite sweatshirt and not being burned alive.
-You’d think it’s Bakugou who’s the possessive one. You’d be wrong. Aoyama’s super possessive and gets jealous so easily it’s ridiculous. Bakugou LOVES it.
-One time, a girl touched Bakugou’s upper arm while they were at the mall and Aoyama threw himself into Bakugou’s chest and made out with him passionately until the girl was forced to just walk away.
-You’ve heard of 'love bites visibly on your man’s neck so people know what’s yours’. Now get ready for ’ YUUGA DID YOU JUST SUCK A HICKEY ONTO MY FUCKING CHEEK WHAT THE FUCKING CHRIST’
-He was so pleased with himself.
-
-(Bakugou would never admit that it was a little hot.)
-Whenever Aoyama’s insecure or gets into a Sad Mood™, Bakugou gives him a piggy back ride to his favorite cheat day restaurant.
-Aoyama sucks at studying because he can never concentrate, so Bakugou finds himself spending entire days dedicated to getting his boyfriend ready for the upcoming test.
-Some people would find it annoying, but Bakugou loves every minute of it.
-Bakugou yells constantly and gets frustrated over the smallest things like losing his key, breaking his pencil, or people being too loud in the commons. Aoyama’s practically an expert at getting him to calm down, at showing him how to care for himself and letting him know that it’s okay to relax.
-Some people would find that taxing, but Aoyama has never minded being there for Bakugou.
-They just love each other. It’s almost sickening sweet.
-And I’m making this too long, but feel free to add on!

So basically Bendy would just grab like a salt shaker or some shit, fucking down it, then his face just contorts into the physical embodiment of dissapointment
More like SUFFERING. Have you tried eating that much salt? YUCK!
Probably not a salt shaker though, it’d have to be less obvious
to myself–
* go to bed between 11:30 and 12:00 so as to get enough sleep
* going to bed earlier is good for your well being
* get up between 7:00 and 8:00. you’ll get a lot more done that way.
* eat b r e a k f a s t, dear one. two meals a day is not good for you. plus it makes you crabby and that’s not good for other people.
* continue clearing out clutter: focus on physical, but include mental and emotional
* go easy on your neck and shoulders: stop leaning and sleeping on them in weird positions
* learn the difference between indulging yourself and being kind to yourself.
* doing whatever you want, whenever you want is not self-care. it is self-sabotage.
* learn to recognize what’s going on inside your own head (self analysis and acceptance)
* figure out your labels or lack of same
* less screen time; less time numbing yourself; use this time for existence
* practice your languages again. you like them, remember?
* practice piano again. you like that too. you just don’t do it much anymore.
* you wanted to learn Dummy! and Spider Dance. do it. and learn more too if you like.
to myself and others (take what you need from this)–
* Your mind tends to wander if left unchecked- this is usually not healthy, so try to keep it in check.
* Remember- a war where the enemies’ strategy is to convince you that the war isn’t actually happening.
* You don’t *have* to do something every day, but you’ll feel extremely bored and guilty if you don’t.
* If you wait till motivation strikes, it will never strike. Do things even without motivation, else you’ll never get them done.
* Don’t forget the struggles you’ve been through, but don’t allow them to overwhelm you either. Learn your lessons and keep hold of them.
* You tend to absorb other people’s emotions, even though you can’t consciously sense it. So if your mood changes suddenly and drastically, it’s likely because of someone in your vicinity. Don’t let it frighten you.
* There’s a very simple solution to waking up quickly- get upright. Whether you’re standing or just kneeling, being upright will trick your brain into waking up quicker.
* Don’t go on Tumblr first thing in the morning. Your brain will be on completely the wrong tangent for the rest of the day and you’ll be frustrated by the amount of fog that exists in your head.
* Yes. Life is short. You are going to die one day. So right now, live. Remember your own mortality, and use it as fuel. Radiate love and support (or rather learn to). Learn everything you can. See other worlds; show other people. Alter reality with what you know.
* You are not worth only what you produce. It doesn’t matter what they say.
* Gender roles are the worst kind of bread (with all the truth that entails).
* Other people are often better or worse than you at things. Don’t expect the same expertise and knowledge from everyone.
* Stop compromising on things you can’t compromise on. If you’re allergic to peanut butter, don’t eat peanut butter! (callout post @ me)
I remixed 4 songs, into one swinging fight theme.
just curious, put your answers in the tags
It’s easy to get the songs from Undertale mixed up.
* Dance. Dance! DANCE!!!
* I DON’T NEED FRIENDS!!! I ONLY NEED TO DANCE!!!
I COMMAND ALL OF YOU TO DANCE!!

SHANLEY VERDICT: Yes. Verdict gives other
victims the courage to come forward
BY DAVID CLOHESSY
Knight Ridder Newspapers
February 13, 2005
(KRT) - Thirty minutes after a Massachusetts jury found ex-priest Paul
Shanley guilty of molesting a boy, I got a call from a man who was also
abused by a priest. ``I've never told anyone except my wife,'' he said.
``That verdict gave me the strength to finally tell someone else.''
To me, that proved that the Shanley verdict was indeed a victory for
us all. Anything that makes it even slightly less difficult for wounded
abuse survivors to come forward is progress.
Because of archaic and rigid statutes of limitations, very few abusive
clergy ever see the inside of a courtroom. Because of timid prosecutors
and excessive deference, virtually no complicit church officials have.
So the mere fact that Shanley faced criminal charges at all was, in itself,
at least a partial victory for the tens of thousands of clergy molestation
victims, many of whom continue to suffer in shame, silence, and self-blame
even now.
The fact that a jury unanimously declared Shanley guilty is even more
significant. Not too many years ago, it was unthinkable that average citizens
could convict a cleric of such horrific crimes.
Most clergy molestation victims disclose their private horror to no one
but a spouse, sibling or dear friend.
Most never pursue criminal or civil charges. Most just try to muddle
along, cope with their pain, and try to forget (often using addictions
like booze, drugs, sex or work). And those who do speak up most often
simply want some acknowledgement that yes, a terrible crime (usually avoidable,
had church authorities acted sooner) was committed against them.
It's rare to get that kind of admission from a bishop, or even a simple
``I'm sorry for what you endured and for how you're still suffering.''
So some of us take legal action. For many, that can ultimately be very
healing.
This is not to minimize the public safety benefit of putting Shanley
behind bars or on probation. Despite his age, he must be considered a
threat. The mere passage of time doesn't magically cure a compulsive predator.
But to the wounded and often fragile psyches of people like me, once trusting
but severely violated Catholics, the Shanley verdict is a ray of hope.
It reminds us that when victims stay silent, nothing changes, but when
victims come forward, sometimes justice is possible and more pain is prevented.
It reminds us that when it's time to report our victimization, it's better
to go to our flawed but time-tested, open, impartial American justice
system, rather to a new, untested, secretive and biased internal church
process.
On the down side, Shanley's depravity has deflected attention away from
even greater depravity: the inexcusable inaction by church officials who
knew about or suspected sex crimes but did nothing to protect innocent
kids and vulnerable adults. That's where our attention should be focused.
Shanley will never be a priest again. But four or five of the clerics
who shielded him and rebuffed his victims still are. In fact, they're
now bishops. There will be no real ``victory'' for men and women who have
been raped by priests and ignored by bishops until these men - top church
officials - are no longer in positions where they can put vulnerable parishioners
at risk.

During the 42- and 51-day pre-treatment periods, the average daily natural mite drop was 0.04 (± 0.04) and 2.82 (± 2.19), respectively, which represents 1.09% (± 1.06) and 3.84% (± 3.04) of the total number of mites found during the experiment. The flumethrin or fluvalinate applications resulted in an average mite mortality at the two apiaries of 214.46 (± 260.02) and 4,098.64 (± 2,508.31). The treatments resulted in a 19.11% (± 14.62) and a 39.28% (± 10.47) reduction in the number of mites in slightly infested colonies and 94.30% (± 4.26) and 96.24% (± 3.14) in highly infested colonies. The difference in treatment efficacy between both apiaries was significant (P < 0.001) and indicates that fluvalinate and flumethrin are highly efficacious in dealing with highly infested honeybee colonies with sealed brood. The importance of effective mite control in colonies with a high level of natural mite mortality is discussed in this study.Ključne besede: Acaricides, control methods, Apis mellifera, oxalic acid, mite infestationObjavljeno: 04.08.2017; Ogledov: 79; Prenosov: 4 Celotno besedilo (149,12 KB)the denim skirt for my seven year old is finished! actually i finished a week ago, just didn’t have the opportunity to photograph it sooner. it’s such a confidence booster to design, draft and sew a project. oh yeah, and have it look good!
[aside: i’m just going to acknowledge that most of the finished product photos are a bit dark and don’t show the detail very well. i even photo edited them lighter. that probably means i need a better camera…]
i added a simple straight waistband. originally i was going to make it 2″ wide, but settled on 1 1/2″. i used underlining to stabilize the waistband and used a thinner cotton material for the waistband facing. this cuts down on the bulk and gives me a chance to add a little color to the inside. which i love! and of course, a little more topstitching.
instead of using an invisible zip, i went with a standard zip. i find that the invisible zips get caught on bulkier seams and i don’t want my daughter to have to struggle to zip her own skirt. she’s the type that would just leave something half zipped if it requires too much effort. we’re working on that.
with the zipper inserted, i added some elastic in the waistband to keep it comfortable for a kid. i stitched the elastic in place at each end, right next to the zipper. then i pulled the facing over and pinned it in place, then from the outside, stitched just under the waistband to catch the facing. in retrospect i probably should have stitched the facing in place along the lower edge first, then threaded the elastic. but… whatevs. this won’t be my last waist band. then to stabilize the top of the waistband i stitched just next to the lower row of topstitching. my dark thread disappears into the denim, so i was able to get a nice crisp top edge.
i hemmed and hawed about whether to stitch the hem in my topstitching gold thread or to hide it with navy thread. i ended up with the gold to give it a more casual look. so that’s that!
as i finished up this skirt i kept thinking: ooh this looks just like something i would pick up in the kids section of j. crew and immediately scoff at the outrageous price! just to find out i took a look over at their website and found a jean skirt.
cute, yes. but $55? considering that i made mine out of leftovers (the original fabric was on sale for about $6.50/yd)… again, why don’t more people sew?
this little one adores her new skirt. her only complaint? the pockets aren’t big enough. she was (and i quote) “hoping they would be big enough to put a book in.” considering her favorite book at the moment is any of the seven harry potter books, that indeed, would be a big pocket. sigh… just can’t win sometimes!

The US Labor Department is now mulling over some legal changes that could restrict the jobs kids can do on farms.
That's because some 16,000 kids are hurt on farms each year and more than 100 are killed. The Labor Department hopes it can drop those numbers with stricter labor laws. But many in the farm community think the regulations might be going too far and could negatively impact the very future of agriculture.
On a whim four years ago, Stefanie Newhouse decided to take an elective ag class at Hudson High School. What she learned piqued her interest so much, she took on two ag-related jobs at a dairy farm and vet clinic.
"At Hansen's, I do everything from feeding calves, milking cows, delivering babies, to artificially inseminating cows. At the vet clinic, I go back with animals during check-ups, help give shots, do heart worm checks," Newhouse said.
The experience has been so valuable, Newhouse has shaped her high school coursework around her new found interests, with the goal of studying animal science in college next fall.
"It's just really an amazing feeling. Like I helped save a calf's life one time. And the adrenaline rush from that is just something you don't really get to do," said Newhouse.
But new proposed labor regulations could threaten the ability for young people like her to gain such experience. The proposed rules mean kids under 18 couldn't work in grain elevators or feed lots. And kids under 16 couldn't operate most power driven equipment. There would also be limitations on working with livestock. Those changes would mostly apply to kids who work on farms not run or supervised by their parents, making it tough for students like Newhouse, whose parents don't farm, to get valuable hands-on training. And educators say that threatens the very future of ag industries.
"We are trying to produce future people in agriculture who are going to feed the world's population. I think that having these regulations in place are really going to hinder students to find that passion early on, because a lot of times students find passion in actually experiencing it and seeing it happen," said Dennis Deppe, Hudson High Ag Science teacher and FFA sponsor.
Deppe says keeping kids safe on farms is a top priority. But he feels that it's best to ensure kids are being supervised by an adult while training and doing farm tasks, rather than banning activities that could give them valuable hands-on experience.
December 1 is the deadline for submitting public comments on the proposed farming child labor changes. You can submit those comments and read the entire proposalOPERATIONS ASSISTANT

“He may win the Oscar for his performance last night,” Axelrod said of Romney, “but he’s not going to win the presidency for his performance last night.”
“Governor Romney came to give a performance, and he gave a good performance, and we give him credit for that. The problem with it was that none of it was rooted in fact. Much of it was rooted in deception,” Axelrod remarked, charging Romney with lying on matters like Medicare and his tax plan.
“It was a very vigorous performance, but one that was devoid of honesty,” Axelrod continued later on in the call, “and so today, on the day after, I think the question for you,.”
Again, Axelrod called Romney a “good performer” when it came to debating. “We saw that in the primaries, and partly because he is completely untethered from the truth. And so we came to Denver, and we were interested to see what he would say, and not surprisingly, what we learned is that he’ll say anything and that makes him effective in the short term, but vulnerable in the long term.”
Romney, Axelrod argued, had done the same in the primary. “He ran well to the right of Governor Perry on the issue of immigration to try and win the Republican nomination. He ran to the right of Rick Santorum on issues like contraception. Now he’s trying to find a way to wind his way back from that.”
Seems like Axelrod might have started believing his own spin: Romney wasn’t to the right of Santorum on social issues, and no GOP candidate favored putting legal restrictions on access to contraception.
UPDATE: “The Obama campaign’s conference call today was just like the President’s performance last night,” says Romney campaign spokesperson Amanda Henneberg in a statement in response. “The campaign, like the President, offered no defense of the President’s first term record or vision for a second term, and instead, offered nothing but false attacks, petulant statements, and lies about Governor Romney’s record.” questions, demands, and are in need of guidance.
Positive patient interactions and experiences not only help the "customer" but also directly affect the bottom line. Anxiety related reactions, ranging from apprehension to inability to complete the test, affect between four and 30 percent of patients undergoing MRI (Melendez & McCrank, 1993). An estimated 2.3 percent of patients cannot complete their MRI scans because of claustrophobia, panic, or other reasons that prevent them from lying still (Dewey, Schink, & Dewey, 2007). This results in hundreds of thousands of dollars of losses every year for the involved facilities. Fortunately such waste of overhead can be limited by simply changing the way staff talks with patients (Lang, Ward, & Laser, 2010).
The promise of medications for distress management is no panacea. When the threshold to use anaesthesia is low, such as in paediatric imaging, it can create a bottleneck when availability of anaesthesia personnel is limited. For this reason – not scanner capacity - waiting times for elective paediatric MRI are currently in the range of several months in Canada.
Another problem that good communication with patients can avoid is no-shows. Support by a communication- trained scheduler or judicious use of scripts can greatly ameliorate this challenge. It pays to have patients arrive with less anxiety: Otherwise their cases will take longer and be more painful (Schupp, Berbaum, Berbaum, & Lang, 2005).
Litigation Headaches Linked to 'Absent' Physicians
Patients who feel their healthcare provider doesn't care are more likely to sue (Levinston, 1994). Malpractice attorneys cite communication issues as the primary reason for filing a suit in more than 80 percent of cases (Avery, 1985). These patients cite having information poorly delivered, and not being understood or valued as leading causes of dissatisfaction (Beckman, Markakis, Suchman, & Frankel, 1995). Responding to the public's frustration with poor doctor-patient relationships, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education now demands that all physicians be trained and are fluent in communication and interpersonal skills (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, 2001). Before embarking on such training one should, however, better understand the sources of patient distress and how they can be addressed efficiently.
Causes of Patient Anxiety and Distress
Patient concerns may encompass possible adverse effects, cancer, pain, or poor outcomes. We measured the distress of 214 women in the radiology waiting room through the analysis of extensive questionnaires (Lang & Flory, 2010). Women awaiting breast biopsy had significantly higher levels of anxiety and perceived stress than women awaiting much riskier procedures, such as chemoembolisation for known liver cancer. They also experienced depressive moods and impact on daily life comparable to those of the cancer patients. Stress levels didn't differ among women coming for embolisation of benign fibroids and those coming for embolisation of cancer. These results identify not knowing the diagnosis as a highly potent stressor. Uncertainty of diagnosis during the wait for final results can even disturb cortisol secretion to a degree similar to that of patients who learned they have cancer (Lang, Berbaum, & Lutgendorf, 2009; Gustafsson et al., 1995).
The distress of patients can be further aggravated by the reactions of the attending facility personnel. Patients who come for examinations or procedures are in a highly suggestible state which makes them vulnerable to a pessimistic interpretation of the information they receive (Ewin & Eimer, 2006). Words, tone, expressions, and context determine if the information creates positive or negative expectations (Bayer, Coverdale, Chiang, & Bangs, 1998). Negative expectations bring about negative outcomes (Silvestri et al., 2003; Spiegel, 1997).
Handing the patient a "panic" button in MRI sets the stage for what to expect. Pain can be insinuated by just mentioning its possibility, as has been shown in a study where volunteers who expected pain, reported pain, even when there were no painful stimuli (Bayer et al., 1998). In an interventional radiology study, negatively-valenced statements (e.g. "just a sting and burn"), as compared to none at all or to neutral ones, increased patients' anxiety and pain when used to announce upcoming stimuli (Lang et al., 2005). Fortunately, it is easy to avoid negative outcomes by simple changes in vocabulary. "I will give you the local anaesthetic," or "I will give you the numbing medicine" will do just fine.
Paradoxically, things can actually become worse when medical personnel want to be particularly nice but are not trained how to express their empathy in a way that helps patients help themselves: Under these conditions haemodynamic disturbances and adverse events can become significantly more frequent in interventional radiology and further stress the patient (Lang et al., 2008).
How to Address Patient Anxiety and Distress
Radiology is a haven of technology. The recourse to fight patient distress with technology is appealing: creating a more patient friendly atmosphere through the lay-out, colouring, placement of art and pictures, offering more "open" equipment design, earplugs for sound suppression, headphones for listening to music, blindfolds or video-goggles for blocking out reality. Technology, however, weighs on the budget and cannot replace the human element that many patients clamour for to overcome their stresses.
Spending more time with patients is not necessarily the answer. Even when doctors take extra time and think they are making special efforts in giving more information and explanations this may not result in greater patient satisfaction (Ley, Bradshaw, Kincey, & Aterton, 1976). One reason resides in the following dynamics (Suchman, Markakis, Beckman, & Frankel, 1997): Patients seldom verbalise their emotions directly; they tend to offer clues instead. When healthcare providers respond to this emotional appeal accurately and acknowledge the patients, communication proceeds smoothly. When healthcare providers return to the preceding topic or sentence sequence, patients remain unsatisfied. Some patients may raise the issue again and again with escalating intensity. Patients who want attention will ultimately get it – which may be at most inopportune times when their attention seeking behaviour disrupts a procedure or a scan. It is thus far more preferable to respond to the patients' needs early on.
Over the past 20 years we worked on and tested solutions that rapidly diffuse patient distress and help patients with painful radiological procedures. We focused on nonpharmacologic methods and started to train healthcare professionals in a more patient-centred talking style, complemented with hypnotic language that directly addresses anxiety, pain and distress. It was important that methods would not require prior patient preparation or selection, any props, or extra time, but could be integrated in routine workflow. Therefore it was important to include rapid rapport skills and ways to positively shape the patients' experience right from the start. We summarised the techniques in a book "Patient sedation without medication. Rapid rapport and quick hypnotic techniques. A resource guide for doctors, nurses, and technologists" (Lang & Laser, 2009). The emphasis of our approach is helping patients help themselves and using what comes naturally. Quirk et al. found that many MRI patients combatted anxiety on their own by using breathing and relaxation techniques, visualising pleasant scenes, and performing mental exercises (Quirk, Letendre, Ciottone, & Lingley, 1989). This type of focused attention on a more pleasant outlook than the immediate surrounding reality is the essence of self-hypnosis. We evolved the concept of guidance in self-hypnotic relaxation in radiology and showed efficacy in three large prospective randomised clinical trials: in the "Lancet Study" testing applicability with concurrent access to IV conscious sedation during vascular and renal procedures; in the "Breast Trial" during large core breast biopsy in a pure outpatient model, and the "Tumour Embolisation Trial" as a model for more invasive therapy with high complication potential (Lang et al., 2000; Lang et al., 2006; Lang et al., 2008).
Patients had less pain, less anxiety, fewer medications, and fewer complications. Being able to increase haemodynamic stability and outcomes came as particularly valuable side effects – not negligible in a climate of mandated safety initiatives, Pay-For-Performance, and trends towards open "Report Cards". Use of these methods resulted in the considerable savings of 338 dollars per case in the catheterisation laboratory (Lang & Rosen, 2002).
Over the years we came to learn that it "takes a village" to have a smooth transition in how communication is used throughout the department. We have developed a method of patient interaction called Comfort TalkTM in which schedulers, receptionists, nurses, technologists, and physicians are extensively trained in advanced rapport skills and setting expectations. A core group of healthcare professionals then provides additional guidance in self-hypnotic relaxation. We used this model when we were asked to help a large private MRI practice. After team training, the non-completion rate of MRIs was reduced by 40 percent and resulted in annual savings of 140,000 dollars, with maintained success at the time of a one-year follow-up (Lang, Ward, & Laser, 2009).
Hypnotic Language in the Modern Healthcare Environment
Although successful use of relaxation and hypnotic techniques in radiology, mainly MRI, dates back to the 80's, these methods received surprisingly little attention (Friday & Kubal, 1990; Klonoff, Janata, & Kaufman, 1986; Quirk, Letenre, Ciottone, & Lingley, 1989). Main impediments were early beliefs that such techniques are best provided by mental health professionals, and that traditional hypnotic techniques and desensitisation approaches just took too long for a busy practice. The beliefs are changing. It has become apparent that guidance in self-hypnotic relaxation on the examination table can be applied without interruption of workflow and that personnel already involved can perform it expertly (Lang & Berbaum, 1997).
Openness towards and usage of alternative approaches has made great strides with the public (Eisenberg et al., 1993). More and more traditional medical institutions are opening alternative centres to respond to the need. The press is extensively reporting positively about use of such methods (). The balance has swung far towards Comfort TalkTM type interventions, which smooth communication and help patients through a stressful time, improve outcomes, and give patients the assurance of caring and the respect they seek. In our experience, patients appreciate the effort made to help them through their examinations. Informed patients will choose their healthcare facilities based on whether they can receive this kind of assistance and will shun places that are hostile to the concept. With patient expectations rising, it makes sense to train one's radiology team in advanced communication.Tattoo shop gives free tattoos for women with Down syndromeBy Mason White 6:35 PM December 7, 2014
By: Chan Yuan
A tattoo shop in New Zealand, has published a photo on Facebook, showing an artist giving a woman who suffers from Down syndrome, a free tattoo.
44-year-old Jason Ward, a tattoo artist at Muscle And Ink Tattoo in Hamilton, said that he applies a temporary tattoo to a woman with Down syndrome every week.
Suzie Barry comes to his shop every Friday, and Ward prepares the skin to give her the real tattoo experience. Ward uses a sticker to apply the tattoo on her skin, and also uses a spray gun and plastic gloves.
Ward treats Barry like a real customer, sitting her down at the table, stenciling her skin and giving her the full tattoo experience.
Barry brings her own stick-on tattoos, and Ward does not charge her for his work. Ward, a father of five children, said that Barry has been coming to his shop every Friday for the past four months.
The photo of Barry getting a tattoo has since gone viral on the Internet.In response to the flood of blog posts being published on our 2013 Stanford Medicine X conference, we are pleased to provide a consolidated list below of some of these postings by topic and author.

Ellen's Wyoming Valley Star Finished - and I Won A Blue Ribbon!
Woooooohooooo! Some days when I have work up to my ears I kind of want to sing "...another one bites the dust..." when I get a major one of those jobs completed! This is another of Ellen's gorgeous quilts. It measures 85" x 85" and it is the pattern is called Wyoming Valley Star (but I'm not sure the pattern maker). I absolutely love the colors she chose - everything! I had created a few mock ups for her but she found something online she really liked and sent me that photo - it was a beautiful example of a quilt finished with Bethanne Nemesh's fill called Nemeshing. I adored the design she sent along and we worked together to adapt it to Ellen's quilt - the result I think is totally gorgeous!
We opted to use double batting again - that has kind of been the trend lately with these very heavily fancy quilted projects I have been working on, and I think it's a very good choice! I recently read on Facebook of a gal who complained she had completed an immense amount of quilting on a recent quilt of her own but it didn't show up in normal lighting. Double batting! :) Really, it works wonders in negative space.
I used the round end of a ditch ruler and Linda Hrcka's swag ruler to create the scallops. I marked the borders first while on the frame, quilted, then echoed the scallops. I love the vintage lace feel this design gives! I chose to quilt the blocks themselves very simply. With all that quilting in the white I just think they didn't need to compete with each other...and quilting doesn't tend to show as brilliantly in dark colors the way it does in lighter fabrics. The best part about this design is when you flip the quilt over there is a chain affect going on!
(Someone will email me about that spot I missed up there - rest easy - I saw it in the photos and fixed it before sending the quilt home.) Below is a photo of the unfinished quilt. I think the quilting really added femininity to the quilt. I had a lot of fun with this one and I think Ellen was pleased with the result!
I used Bottom Line in Cream for the quilting - this is becoming my go to thread for client quilts. It gives great texture without building up and though it's comparable in price to my all time favorite Invisifil for fills, it's a lot less finicky or prone to breakage. Superior reps have mentioned something in the future that is supposed to be comparable to Invisifil that isn't silk - I really wish that would happen soon!
In other news, Thursday was the opening reception at the quilt show!!! Woohooo!!! Many friends were represented with quilts, won ribbons, and guess what? I won a blue ribbon!!!
This is my friend Joyce's quilt - she won blue in her category! Congratulations Joyce! I quilted this one for her last winter, it's gorgeous! I believe it is a Kim Diehl pattern she made in civil war reproduction fabrics. It is just absolutely gorgeous and got a lot of attention at the show and also here on my blog!
Then...to my shock, aww, thrill, and delight...my ugly green quilt won a ribbon!!! LOL! I am OVER the moon!!! Not just a ribbon, a blue ribbon!!! Ribbons are not everything I know I know. But listen, when you work REALLY REALLY hard, it feels amazing to get that tiny little bit of validation. It felt really really good! My home show, the one all my friends and family will go to, and my little quilt has a pretty blue ribbon by it. By golly that is a great feeling and I'm so so thrilled and honored!
I am not ashamed I am probably going to wear it in my hair! I did hear a bit of whispering and complaining through the crowd about the judging. I suspect this is not uncommon and I doubt it was limited to this one show in particular. I have been a fly on the wall to many conversations about quilt show judging. I will say I really really respect judges in general. It has to be an incredibly tough job. Not only is it hard to critique work - it HAS to be hard to know that some folks will not be pleased with your decision. I'd like to think that most folks are fair and honest - judges included. For what it's worth this show does use NQA certified judges (where will folks get certified to judge now that NQA is gone I wonder?) and some of the quilts that have won here have gone on to win at big national shows around the country. My personal feeling - and I have been a big time loser at a number of good shows - it's a gamble every time but SUPER fun when you win - and worse things have been said about me and my quilts than "that shouldn't have got a ribbon". So don't let a loss stop you from entering, and don't let comments get under your skin. I think shows are super important for the growth and support of an art form. I would have NEVER gotten into quilting to the extent I have if not for this show in particular. It was the first time I was exposed to the quilt world as it is today.
I also ran into Cindi whose quilt is below - she walked up to me and said "Valerie? I read your blog!" Well guess what, I was a little tongue tied for a minute thinking "people read my blog?" LOL! I was so so so excited to meet you Cindi and how funny is it that your quilt was one of my ABSOLUTE favorites at the show!!! Apparently the judges favorite too - look at that blue ribbon!!! Congratulations!!! I think you need to let me shop your fabric stash as those colors are totally up my ally!
Next post I will share more photos from the quilt show. I haven't decided if I'll take another visit up there or not - it was a little tough to get all the photos I wanted as there were just SO many folks there! It was a big and fun event. If you're in the NE Ohio area Lake Farm Parks Quilts 2016 is now open and totally worth a visit.

Breitbart.tv Old Guy in I Am a M*********** T-Shirt Pummels Younger Man on California Bus
What this has to do with politics, I have no idea.
Man, he beat the shit outta that blowhard.
It was hilarious how after being pummled the other guy was still claiming he would kick teh old guy's ass.
Even better was the woman taping who claimed she would sue the old guy, after the first dude hit the old guy first!
Let me guess, it was at the back of the bus too.
I have serious doubts about the theory of evolution. At least where humankind is concerned.
It was definitely an epic beatdown. It's usually a pleasure to see a loudmouth get his chin checked and this was no exception.
I like how after he gets up the black guy is still mumbling something about beating the other dude's ass.
Its a lesson, don't think you are going to intimidate everyone, some people fight back, even crazy old white dudes.
I wish the crazy old dude threw him out the bus while screaming, "get off my lawn!" in that psycho voice he was using.
'It aint worth it blood!'
She was right. Bumpin' his gums wasn't worth that ass beatin'!
No wonder Charlie Bass hasn't posted in so many hours!

Separate names with a comma.You can take this International Shoe and stick it right up your tailpipe!Folks, you need to read this in its entirety. There is a lot here -- and it covers a very common situation related to commercial suits.
Here's the story (from a upset citizen, addressed to us):
I purchased a product of an online company which I believe to be based in California. The product was listed as "The Stage 1 Performance chip uses the latest in aftermarket ECU technology to tweak computer parameters to the most optimal performance setting." When I received this product in the mail and physically looked at where this "said performance chip" was to be installed, I realized this was nothing more than a basic electrical resistor (maybe a $5 part) in a gray case and a red slide to "adjust the performance or economy" of the part in question. This has everything to do with Tricking your computer into thinking your vehicle is receiving too much or too little air through the Mass airflow sensor and telling the computer to allow more fuel or decrease fuel to air mixture.
I never opened the package and within days of receiving this product I sent them an email notice (per their request for any returns for refunds) through their website message system because they do not list an email address or phone number to make returns for refund.
Their guarantee states:
PerformanceChipTuning offers a 14-Day Guarantee. If you are not satisfied with your purchase within 14 days of receipt you may send the product back for a refund according to our requirements: All products returned must be in new condition, original packaging.
Their return policy states:
For returns, please Email us us within 14. I have an email confirmation of purchase on 01/18/2014. I received shipment of this product 01/28/2014 per USPS tracking number. I sent this package back VIA UPS with signature only to ensure that the product was retuned 02/05/2014 and it was received and signed for on 02/11/2014 11:08AM at the only address I found anywhere for this company and that was back to the original warehouse where this product was shipped from to me.
They finally answered:
-----
Hello,
We have not been able to find your package with the information given. It may have gone to another warehouse. Since this was from a few months ago, we will not be able to refund the account.
Warehouse
------
I believe this company has scammed many people out of a lot of money by falsely advertising a false product and have not stood by many (IF any) returns per their policy agreements.
I want to know what and ALL legal action I can take against this company for what they have done to myself and possibly thousands of other customers who were scammed by this company and their bogus products and selling a $5 product for $69.99 & $9.99 shipping.
At first this was just about getting back my money for this product. Upon their refusal to grant me my refund, it is now about shutting this bogus company down for good to protect other consumers from being scammed by other internet companies that prey on consumers with false advertising, cheap products, and not following their own return agreements.
I always warn clients to be careful. When a $70 frustration turns into ideas for million-dollar lawsuits, you need to take a step back, breath deeply, and get fresh air. Bluntly, you don't have the resources, or even the standing, to lead a class-action lawsuit like this.
Also, you have to be courageous. You have to admit you made a bone-head error. That's okay -- I can't tell you the number of times I accidentally bought something on Ebay that had a "great" price -- only to find out I owed twice my bid in shipping. Whoops!
It sounds like you made mistake buying this -- realized it after you have hit "purchase", and then tried to get out of the mistake you made. Bottom-line -- this just is not going to happen.
But why, you ask?
First, you are not located in the same state (and most likely, not even in the same country) as the seller. While the seller mailed you something, mere mailing does not give sufficient contact with the forum state (that would be where you live) to actually subject the seller to personal jurisdiction (in your state). For a lively and informative discussion on personal jurisdiction in the context of commercial transactions, read International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945).
Alright, I'm kidding. Shoe is a snooze fest of epic proportion, and unless you have nothing else to do with your life, you should probably avoid it. Just take my word for it -- your seller probably likes sufficient contact in your forum state for you to get any kind of suit against them going where you live.
BUT...if that were not enough, you also have the problem of enforcement of foreign judgments. It is often a great misunderstood truism in the legal world that "suing" someone means you'll get paid. Nope. You must sue someone, win, and then you must collect. Good luck, my friend!
But why, you ask?
Well, let me tell you! Most likely, if the court found it had sufficient personal jurisdiction over the defendant (not likely as previously discussed), the defendant company would just ignore you. At which point, you would timely move for default judgment. Boom! You win -- right? Well, no. Default judgment is not a trial on the merits -- so you cannot enforce the judgment outside of your state. Uh oh. If the seller lives in another state, and you have to try to collect in that other state...damn! You can't!
But I REALLY want to sue them because I am SOOOO MAD!
Great! Hire a lawyer in the home state where the seller is located, and be prepared to fly there to testify against them. Suddenly, you understand why a $70 fu-bar is NOT worth a $10K lawsuit. Did I say $10,000? Sure did! A jury trial will cost at least that much, and -- oh by the way -- it takes a year or even two to get to the trial stage. Then...you have to assume they have any money to win. Oh, and you have to prove your damages -- beyond the $70 you paid.
In the end, very very rarely are anger or vengeance suits worth anything. If you have a lot of disposable income and wish to protect your fellow citizens, then by all means -- go for it. But for the rest of us...take a long walk outside. Realize you weren't thinking clearly when you made the purchase. Post complaints with the better business bureau and every online blog you can find...and then write-it-off as a loss. You'll be a lot happier in the end.

Share your thoughts with us!A while back, I asked my readers to Spin Me A Yarn about their personal crochet journey. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing you to Karen from:
Karen Lynne Beads.
Karen has chosen to tell us about something she’s working on right now. Without any further distraction from me, here’s Karen!
Hi! My name is Karen.
I’ve been crocheting since I was about 8. I think that’s right. Over forty years. I figure I’ve got this down pretty good.
As I’ve always been fascinated by the idea, I decided to teach myself Tunisian crochet. Looked at BLOGs, watched some u-tube videos, bought the funny looking hook. I finally sat down and started to Tunisian crochet. Did a small sample and decided this wasn’t too bad. So, I grabbed some yarn from my stash and set out to make a scarf.
You know what? I hate this stitch. The scarf is wider then the sample was, and I’m running into the problem of how do you hold the hook? If I hold it where I usually do, then my fingers are in the way of the yarn on the hook. If I hold it farther down, it’s all awkward. And the stitches are not consistent. They are loose on the two ends, but too tight in the middle.
And it CURLS!!! What is up with that?
I’ve done about six inches. That’s not long enough for a scarf. It’s done in acrylic yarn so, even if I could get it to lie flat, it wouldn’t make a very good pot holder.
Ribbet!
Karen’s Creation!
Thank you so much, Karen, for sharing with me and my readers! Personally, I think it looks pretty good! I’m not sure how to make it stop curling though.
Anyone know how to help Karen with Tunisian crochet? If you have any suggestions, please share them in the comments and be sure to let Karen know how much you enjoyed reading her yarn.
If you’re interested in spinning a yarn for us, visit my Spin Me A Yarn post to learn how you can be featured in an interview here at Imperial Crochet.
Thanks for posting my story, Robin. I had fun writing this for you.

It was my pleasure Karen. Thank you so much! I appreciate it.
Oh no! I love Tunisian crochet! Don’t give up on it. It does tend to curl but there are ways to fix that. Ironically, I just made some sleeves for a coat that I’m working on using Tunisian crochet. I hate the sleeves but not because of the Tunisian crochet. I picked the wrong color and it doesn’t work. And I agree that your attempt looks lovely and looks as it should look. There are different ways to hold the hook to make it less awkward. I should probably post more about this style of crochet. I think I will. 🙂

My experience with Tunisian crochet is that it does tend to curl unfortunately. It’s worth sticking with though! There are a lot of pretty stitches that you can learn and you’ll find a way to hold the hook that works in time.

The Tunisian curls!! I thought when I first learned Tunisian that I was doing something wrong – it’s just one of those things. Try using a larger hook size. My biggest mistake was not knowing that for Tunisian you should go up at least one size larger than what the yarn recommends. There are other Tunisian techniques that aren’t as curly – Entrelac is lovely and doesn’t curl. It’s definitely a nice technique to add to your repertoire! Love the “Yarn” you spun! 😀

Thank you for sharing Crocheted Butterfly!Otherwise you wind up with a credibility gap. It’s bad enough for ordinary people, but when you are – for example – the Premier of a province, having people doubt that what you say is true, you are pretty much headed for disaster.
Now Kathy Dunderdale has had a problem with getting things straight before, so, for many readers of these e-scribbles, this latest episode will come as no shock. They can just look at this as more evidence of the problem the Premier has with figuring out a whole bunch of things lately.
On Tuesday, Liberal leader Dwight Ball asked the Premier for details on her meeting with the Prime Minister. As it turns out, she hadn’t asked for one at that point, but that’s another issue. Ball prefaced his question by saying the Liberals had been telling the Premier to cut out the letter exchange and meet face to face.
So the Kathy Dunderdale said:
The rewriting of history goes on, Mr. Speaker. Never in the last few months has the Leader of the Opposition or any of his colleagues asked me to organize face-to-face meetings with the Prime Minister. I have done so on my own initiative and recently made the request for a meeting with the Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker.Ummm.
Well…
no.
March 26. Yvonne Jones:
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, but the letter-writing campaign is just not enough. We were told by the Minister of Municipal Affairs weeks ago that there were letters sent to Ottawa, which we have not seen any response to yet on this. His response is like the response that I got from Stephen Harper's office; there is not much odds about it, Mr. Speaker.
I ask you today, Premier: Are you prepared to go to Ottawa - because we are prepared to go with you, stand with you shoulder to shoulder - and fight the federal government? If you are not prepared to do it, Mr. Speaker, we are prepared to go and rally on Parliament Hill without you. Which way would you like to have it?Now that’s one incident. It’s not like Dunderdale forgot. After all, she continuously needles the Liberals about the meeting they did arrange after that exchange.
But here’s the thing: the Liberals did push the idea of meeting while Dunderdale insisted – until now – that she had everything under control and that her letter-writing campaign was fine. She has said her relationship with the Prime Minister is fine, even though the Premier and her staff had some difficulty arranging a simple telephone call in which Dunderdale was on one end of the line and PMSH was on the other.
She got nothing out of the call, incidentally, except a pain in her neck.
If the Premier and her crew don’t fall into a bottomless credibility gap first, they will leave everyone confused by their shifting positions, explanations and excuses. She doesn’t have to look very hard to see one possible explanation for her political problems.
And, of course, once she recognises there is a problem, she can correct it.
She just has to recognise there is a problem first.
You’ve got to understand:
- that you are in a hole,
- that being in the hole is a bad thing,
- that getting out of the hole is a good idea, and,
- that the best way to get out of the hole is to stop digging.

Kinds of Internet site Hosting Available in Robins IA
There are various sorts of shared hosting bundles suitable for different website in regards to the system resources or the common organizing system they need. To pick one of the most appropriate common holding service for your web website, you must review exactly what server-side software program it needs, how many everyday gos to you anticipate at the beginning and also over time, in addition to any other special demands that could have to be covered.
One of the most suitable alternative for tiny sized online websites with numerous hundred or a number of thousand customers is a shared organizing account. With this form of web area holding, each consumer pays just for their account, which reduces the total expense per individual significantly. There are various webhosting accounts varying from one organizing vendor to one more, equipping different quotas of web server storage space as well as regular monthly bandwidth, various e-mail quotas and so forth. The benefit is that you could obtain an account that will certainly give the specifications your websites in fact needs. You will not need to pay lots of money for a package you will not use, or end up with a little sized bundle that could not organize the website. We, at I Like Myhost- Hosting, offer a terrific selection of shared organizing accounts suitable for individual or small company sites that also include pre-installed script-powered platforms like Joomla, Mambo, Drupal or WordPress – to make points simpler. If you commence with a much less effective plan and you need more performances, moving to a premium account takes simply a click.
A drawback of the common hosting environment is that the web servers have some software applications installed on them and also you could not activate added software program. Provided sites, mainly web storefronts, demand applications to be activated on the holding web server for them to run, and also with a common hosting account, you can install just software application that does not demand complete web server root gain access to. Online Servers as well as Dedicated Web servers
For internet sites that request total root-level gain access to, or if your portal has numerous thousands or even countless daily audiences, what you require is an online exclusive web servers or a devoted web server. A personal online web server is a software application emulation of a devoted solution and also it performs in precisely similarly.
Online Private Web Web servers
Like the common internet hosting plans, the digital exclusive web servers as well as the committed server plans include varied performances depending on just what the holding business deals. A digital web server internet hosting package includes assured web server storage space, arbitrary gain access to memory as well as main processing system use allocations that could sometimes be enhanced for short periods of time provided that there are extra sources on the physical server. With a devoted web organizing server, the only restriction is the equipment it is utilizing, and it could be revved up by transforming or adding components.
Devoted Servers
Still, provided hosting companies provide managed committed web server organizing services where they do webhosting server administration jobs in behalf of the client. This could be a component of plan or an added alternative.
Prior To Getting to a Decision in Robins
Deciding on the top holding plan is crucial as it can impact the proper performance of an on the internet portal. Before choosing a strategy, contrast the pros and cons, check totally all the prerequisites for the internet site to function properly, particularly if it is script-driven.I got a Hold Heet glue pot, 1 pint size with lid, from The Best Things Co.
I also bought a bunch of Miro Moose cam clamps (made by the Dubuque Clamp Works in Iowa) from them as well.
They are the only people I know of who sell the 1 pint size glue pots which is plenty big enough for my gluing needs!
I like the cam clamps. They have maple jaws and work well. They are cheaper by a buck or 2 than any you will find online I believe.

Using a distinctive brand, your company will stick out and become remarkable to customers.

Also, building a distinctive logo design to visit with your production can further more the memo ability of your company. You must upload your sell your beats so that they are plentiful for buyers to listen for and purchase. There are lots of defeat marketing websites and you should upload to as the majority of them as you possibly can. The more coverage, the more effective! Many of these overcome offering sites require a commission from your income, but it’s never ever a lot. Sound Click and MyFlashStore both are free, and so they possess the top targeted traffic of fans. I recommend making a free account on every single. After you have your MyFlashStore person (or another media gamer) good to go, add it on as many other web sites as you can!
Design Your Own Website:
Developing your personal generation web site is important to be able to stay ahead of your competitors. Once you add beats for some other beat marketing sites, like rebottle, you might be revealing room with a large number of other producers. Your individual production internet site is entirely the one you have, as well as a place where one can actually get in touch with your audience. You’ll must purchase a domain name (ex. JohnSmithBeats) and then make the design as neat and skilled as possible.
Inside your internet site is sure to add the pursuing:
-Production manufacturer / Logo
-Your beat retailer (You are able to add the myflashstore person OR embed every other press player as well as PayPal take a look at control keys if check out is not really incorporated into gamer)
-Contact information (email, Flicker, Facebook, YouTube. com, weblog, and so forth…)
-Clarification of legal rights (lease contract vs. unique)
Wow factor, quick biography, manufacturing credits, resume, or other details you feel your viewers would locate beneficial Subscriber List: Developing an email list is essential. E-mail is among the most effective ways to directly marketplace to the prospective customers. There are several mailing list services which are free of charge, I would recommend Mail Chimp. It is possible to embed a sign-up type entirely on your web site. Also I advise providing a free of charge defeat to anybody who signs up, so they come with a motivation to sign up with. As soon as they sign-up, your mailing list service will retailer their email address and name. With this information, you are able to send an e-newsletter regularly to promote in your market.Amél. This leads her to invent all sorts of strategies to intervene in the existence of the people around her. Among them the concierge who spends her day sipping port while communing with a stuffed dog; Georgette, the hypochondriac newsdealer; and the “glass man”, Amélie’s neighbor who lives vicariously through a Renoir reproduction. Amélie’s mission is rudely interrupted when she meets a strange, off-beat young man, Nino Quincampoix. Nino works shift jobs on a ghost train and in a sex shop, and collects photos littering the ground outside automatic photo booths. He’s desperately trying to identify the stranger whose photo keeps turning up, when his search is suddenly interrupted by his encounter with Amélie. Although fascinated by him, she plays hide-and-seek games, afraid of really opening up to this appealing young man. After several attempts at getting more serious, she takes to her heels. Fortunately the “glass man”, himself an expert on withdrawal, repays her in kind for all she’s done for him by pushing her into Nino’s arms.

Elijah confronts these Israelites who had chosen to serve Jezebel and not serve the One and Only YHVH. Ahab was caught in the middle of the conflict, with Jezebel calling the shots. The whole story takes place in the north of Israel atop Mount Carmel!
The drama then concludes at the Brook Kishon where the bold and zealous Elijah slaughters these prophets of Jezebel’s table, according to 1 Kings 18:40.Wildfire smoke blanketing the state from the California border to the Columbia River put a crimp into air travel Tuesday afternoon.

Scott Baker of Gold Hill was one of the dozens of passengers queued up where Alaska's Q400s park at the Portland airport. Given the decaying visibility even in Portland, he said the passengers took it all in stride.
"It is what it is," Baker said. "There isn't anything we can do about it, we can't say, 'land the damn thing.'"
Ashland resident Don Senter has dealt with fog delays, but the smokeout was a new experience.
"They told us we could not land, and they turned around about three-quarters of the way," Senter said. "We had to circle here (in Portland) once while the firefighters landed."
Medford airport Director Bern Case said it's the only smoke-related cancellation so far.
"There was an earlier cancellation, but it was pretty clear here at the time. I believe it was due to a pilot shortage or crew issue."
Case said that all the planes that overnight in Medford arrived Tuesday and all Wednesday morning flights departed without a hitch.
"I didn't see any angry people standing around when I came to work this morning," Case said.
The opaque skies, however, remained intact.
"It's sort of like fog season, but there's not much we can do about it," Case said. "When I can't see Coker Butte out my window, I know it's bad. But I do see the immigration building across the airport and that means we have three-eighths-of-a-mile visibility. Most commercial airlines can operate with that much visibility, although Allegiant might be an exception."
While fire operations have been continual, general aviation has essentially been non-existent.
"The little guys enjoy flying around and looking at the world," Case said. "But looking through this muck is not very exciting."

(Photo by Greg Doherty/Getty Images) (2016 Getty Images)
A very pregnant Blac Chyna channeled her soon-to-be sister-in-law and posed nude for the cover of the upcoming issue of Paper Magazine.
Chyna, the future Mrs. Rob Kardashian, posed as part of the magazine’s Beautiful People Class of 2016 issue, wearing an ornate gold necklace and little else.
The 28-year-old reality star, who is of Dominican descent on her mother’s side, puts her tattoos on full display and shows off the massive 7-carat diamond engagement ring Kardashian gave her. The inside photo spread includes several different looks that highlight her pregnant curves.
Chyna told the magazine that she is excited about her fans getting to know more of her as a person and not “as a thing or a face” in her upcoming reality show, “Rob & Chyna.”

“I hope when people think about Blac Chyna, they think of a mogul and entrepreneur, a mother and a badass b----,” she said.
Chyna is not the only in the Kardashian clan to have done covers for Paper – or to have posed in the nude. Kim Kardashian famously posed for the magazine in late 2014, exposing her ample derriere.
And Kourtney Kardashian posed for Du Jour in 2014. She dished at the time that she had posed naked for photos while pregnant with her first son, Mason.
“I love it. The photo is hanging in the entry of my mom’s house.”
The same year she also posted on Instagram side-by-side pictures of her mother, Kris, and herself, both posed and pregnant.
Kim Kardashian also took to Instagram to show off her expectant figure a year ago and to fight off body-shamers.
“I’m grateful to God for this miracle, and no matter what rumors or comments you throw my way, this time they truly don’t affect me!” she wrote.

It has been a average week for the Portland Timbers with some good news and some bad news. They finally announced our next coach for the 2013 season and the Timbers defeated Colorado at home. However, we were right back to where we were losing on the road to the Colorado Rapids. At one point of time we were out of last place only to find ourselves back down there again. For me this is what comes to being a Timbers fan: having the highs and lows within a span of 7 days.
The first good news was defeating the Rapids at home 1-0. It was very simple playing at home and winning is nothing new, but it gave us something that we did not have in a while which was confidence. Confident that maybe, just maybe, we could have gotten a hot streak coming out of that win. We had our defense very sturdy, our team meshing in all the right positions, and we had players who were predominately on the bench all season outshine and outperform expectations on the field. Sal Zizzo and Bright Dike really were the stars of the night. Dike was the one who scored what turned out to be the game-winning goal. It was a remarkable game and lead to people to think that maybe the tide has turned..>> during the race, fans will also find it much easier to have their say as changes to the voting system will make it possible to vote using a hashtag on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. This has been achieved through a partnership with Telescope, the global leader in real-time fan engagement.
Voting will be possible through the official Formula E website and app and fans will be able to vote once a day through each of the available channels. As was the case during season one, FanBoost voting will open 12 days before the race takes place, which means that voting will open for the Beijing ePrix on Monday, October 12.
As a result of these changes FanBoost will only be available on the car that the drivers get into following their mid-race car swap.
. “We are delighted to partner with Telescope, who have a proven track record in this field, and with their expertise we will evolve the FanBoost concept to become a standard bearer for fan interactivity in sport.”
Unlike last year FanBoost will provide an extra 100kJ of energy to be used in a power window between 180kW and 200kW..”
This presents the three winning teams and drivers with a strategic call to make. Do they raise the power for a short boost or run at a slightly lower power for a prolonged period? As before, FanBoost can only be used once, rather than in a series of short bursts. […]About

Ephesians 5:25 After His Incarnation, then, is Christ the head of man, for His self-surrenderissuedmay.Five days ago you explored the suspicious-looking shop of a coffin maker and found a group of vampires hidden in the attic. The vampires killed one of your companions and chased off the rest of you. Fleeing to the burgomaster’s mansion in terror you discovered that the vampires had stopped following you. You spent the night in the mansion awaiting the safety of daybreak before venturing outside again. You then spent several days searching in vain for signs of the missing vampires who had left the shop and apparently moved their resting places to different, unknown locations. A day later, while continuing your search, you heard screams coming from the town’s church. Investigating, you discovered the church was under attack by the same vampires that had attacked you and that people were fleeing the church. The vampires attacked the church and the priest inside it. You saved the priest from certain death and drove off the vampires, returning to the burgomaster’s mansion to report what had happened. The next day, most of the townsfolk, along with many of the town guard, rose up in anger and marched on the Burgomaster’s mansion in an effort to kill him. Your party intervened and convinced the mob to spare the burgomaster’s life. In return, you gave them assurances that the burgomaster would never again rule and that Brick would instead become the town’s burgomaster and eliminate all the festivals. when making this deal you also made a deal with the burgomaster telling him that you would spare his life and keep the townsfolk from lynching him as long as he assisted you in providing advice on ruling and the town’s taxes and finances and such. Brick then decided to spend the next few days with the former burgomaster to learn from him and take over his duties. While he did this, Mort and a few others set off to investigate the strange fisherman who kept going to the lake and not returning with any fish. They discovered the man was under a strange trance and followed him to the lake where he then tried to get into a boat with a bundled-up girl. Freeing the girl from his clutches you then decided to take her to safety. She said that her father could be found at a Vistani camp near town. While traveling toward the camp, the girl has become sullen and started to act strange. You have just brought her to town and you are now preparing to take her home, calming her and assuring her that she will soon be with her father. Stopping in briefly to report your findings to Brick, you have now gathered up the girl and are setting out again on the road to take her back to her father at the nearby Vistani camp. As you do so, a large human approaches you. He is over six feet tall and very muscular, a young man, you guess about 18, outfitted in old, antiquated armor you don’t recognize and carrying a shield. A warhammer hangs from his belt and a crossbow is strapped to his back. Around his neck he wears an amulet fashioned to look like a shield with a hammer emblazoned on it. His hair and eyes are dark brown in color. He introduces himself, saying his name is Luther and he has heard of you and your most recent battle with the vampires, and that you are hoping to defeat Strahd and leave this realm. “Well, I would like to join you,” he says. “If you’ll have me. I wish to leave this world, too. My parents came from another world 18 years ago, a different one than yours, and they died when I was young. I’ve lived in this nightmarish place ever since, and I want out. I don’t care where. Anywhere but here. I can be of help. My father taught me about Krom, our god, and told me bits and pieces of our world. Taught me to fight. I have never seen their world, but that is how I got all this:” he points to his equipment. “This was all my father’s: the armor, weapons, amulet. It is he who taught me to speak to Krom, though the connection feels strained here and sullied by Strahd’s repressive magic.”
Have Brick’s uncle Amdol step in with a gruff, commanding voice. He says, "A brave enough lad, sure enough, and big… Hmfff…any help is welcome, that’s for sure… but definitely wet behind the ears. One nibble on his neck will drop him dead like a fainting maiden, I recken. I say he stays to the back of our group and out of the way. "
Have Ismark add in a lisp, “I’ll watttch over him. He can ssstay in front of me, in casthe theirs an ambuth.”
As the others begin to add to the discussion, Arabelle, the girl they are escorting, butts in and looks at him strangely and says “Yes, it is him…I see it now.” What she means by this you are not sure, but then she suddenly begins to convulse and goes silent, falling to the ground and continuing to shake, frothing from the mouth and uttering strange words, her eyes rolling into the back of her head.

Crochet Rug Upcycle Pattern and Tutorial – King SoleilLast season, The Flash had its debut on The CW and delivered some of the best ratings that the fifth place network has seen in years. It bowed with a 1.9 score based on the overnights for the 18-48 demographic and ended up averaging a 1.4 rating for the season. And in the Spring months, that show regularly defied the ratings slump as it continued to pull very respectable numbers for its network. So with its second season about to start, will it continue to outpace the slumping numbers of the broadcast networks and still act as the ratings leader for The CW? If it debuts anywhere near the 1.9 score it had last year, that could put it ahead of quite a number of other shows on the broadcast nets for the night including ABC’s Agents of SHIELD and FOX’s Scream Queens. Cast your vote below on how you think it will perform and be sure to keep your eye on the Cancelled Sci Fi Twitter Site on Wednesday for the ratings results.
POLL CLOSED: The debut numbers were a 1.4 rating based on the overnights for the 18-49 demographic with 3.6 million total viewers. Very good second season numbers for a CW show (and it beat everything on FOX’s schedule for the night).

Grateful to have met you, I’ll be there ‘till the end
I’ll love you eternally, as one of my dearest friends!
YOU – PART II
You’re a lyer and a cheat
Oh so comfy in your seat
Waiting for the world to change
Making choices to you is strange
There you are, mister insecure
Never moving, of that I’m sure
Be a man, stand your ground!
You know what you want, now make a sound
All those words, they seem so empty now
Thinking of you now makes me down
You told me that you missed me
You told me you need me
You said you couldn’t go on without me
You told me you love me...
A scared little boy, that’s what you are
A scared little boy, who’s gone too far
Scared of making changes in your life
Scared to make someone else your wife
Well I’m not afraid and I’m not scared
I’m thinking of everything we shared
I want to believe how love can conquer all
Now it’s up to you to take that fall..
I’ll be right here waiting!
YOU
You’re the prettiest
You’re the best
You’re the sexiest
With you I’m blessed
You’re the sweetest
You’re my ultimate test
You’re the dearest
God I’m so depressed…
Thinking of losing you makes me panic
Thinking of hurting you makes me manic
Thinking of not seeing you makes me cry
Please tell me we’ll never say goodbye
You make me smile
You make me happy
You make me feel worthwhile
I can see it all so clearly
You make me dream
You make me cheer
You make me feel supreme
You are so dear
You and me, we can make this happen
You and me, a powerful weapon
You and me, we’re meant to be
You and me, just wish you could see……
…….. the truth about me
I know, I know, I’m oh so wrong
My head keeps telling but the heart’s too strong
Feeling guilty and sad, even dirty perhaps
Marching to hell with major steps
No redemption for me anywhere near
It’s a gigantic fight I really fear
Why do bad things feel so good?
Gotta stop this madness, if only I could
Addicted to you: my world, my love
Compared to whoever you’re up and above
Feeling so guilty, I’m not gonna lie
Feeling so lonely, I just wanna cry
Stop me if I’m out of line
But I really hope that you’ll be mine
My feelings for you are far too strong
I cherish them, although they’re wrong
You are the one that I desire
Inside of me there’s a raging fire
I’ll love you ‘till the end of times
Always and always, not just sometimes
I trust in you, do you trust in me?
It’s not equally devided, so it seems to be
A lack of trust, lack of faith
Continuously trapped in the same debate
Damn it, I love you… Why would I lie?
You don’t trust me, please tell me why…
All them questions, waiting on a shelf
Tell me something baby, can you even trust yourself?
Some might say you’re insecure
If that’s the case, tell me your cure
Really can’t handle all this shit
Getting annoyed, I must admit
How can I take your doubts away?
How can I convince you to stay?
How can I prove my love is for real?
You’re the only one, that’s the deal
Am I stupid to trust you so blind?
Is there maybe something for me to find?
By distrusting me, I start to distrust you
Are all those beautiful words even true?
How does it feel to be under suspicion
When clearing your name is your only mission
Please believe when I say you are the one
And stop this madness, because I’m done
Is this the end
Are we through?
All those hours spend
I’m not letting go, are you?
Wasn’t gonna be easy
We knew that from the start
feeling bad and sleazy
being together yet still apart
Now we both feel like shit
Feel like we wanna die
I feel like I’ve been hit
Feel so lonely I just wanna cry
What are we doing?
Why don’t we put this to an end
All the lives we’re ruining
It’s getting harder to pretend
I love you with all my heart
But deep inside I know
You’ll never make a brand new start
You’ll never make the choice to go
So now I’m here
Waiting in vain
Staring at my precious dear
Causing me so much pain
You know I’ll be there for you
Right here waiting is what we said
I’d go to the end of the world, it’s true
But all my hope is dead
So is this the end?
Are we through?
All those hours spend
I don’t wanna let go, do you?
Is this how love’s supposed to be?
Him making choices, never thinking ‘bout me
Aren’t my feelings important or real?
So damn selfish, always HIS deal
Do I really want this for me?
Daily wandering what today’s gonna be
Do I really want someone that makes me insecure?
How much more of this am I willing to endure?
My love’s too strong, I always let him get away...
Always some promise that makes me stay
Falling apart, with no one to blame
Tired of forgiving, putting my foot down
I know he’s not moving, he’s not gonna change
Let’s face it: he’s far out of range
So it’s time to make a choice
Let him hear my voice
It’s him who has to make a move
It’s him who’s got so much to prove
And when he backs away
There’s nothing left for me to say
HOPE
I agree, the signs are not that good
I agree, it’s a lot more than I first understood
I agree, I under estimated the situation
I agree, there’s no sight at clarification
I know, the world seems to disagree
But hey baby, this is ‘bout you and me
Can you see beyond this?
Can you see beyond the pain?
Can you imagine us kiss?
Or is this hurting all in vain?
I’ve got hope baby dear,
I’ve got hope that our future is near
I’ve got hope that you’ll be mine
I’ve got hope and I’ve got the time
I’ve got hope this situation will pass
I want it to be you I will caress
Can you join me in my dream
Can you feel the hope I feel
You and me we’d be supreme
Do we have a deal?
There’s something you should know
First of all: I love you so!
Life without you sounds impossible
My feelings for you are unstoppable
Can you tell me where we stand
Please come over here en take my hand
Tell me we’ll be together soon
Tell me we’ll live happily for years to come
Tell me you’ll love me ‘till the moon
Tell me we’ll have a great outcome
Tell me we’ll make it.......From Mind Connections- Read about the Benefits of forgiveness
To live life is to be let down. Disappointment just seems to come with the territory. We then have a few simple choices, to carry around the anger of being hurt or to forgive and move on. Sometimes the actions are so painful that it seems impossible to forgive, like you will be letting the person that wronged you off the hook. That is the exact attitude that keeps you suffering and under the control of an event or actions of others for a long time. There are many benefits of forgiveness the will make your life a more enjoyable experience .Commodity Intelligence LLP

We divide the year and use what is called split year groups. This is the case until Year 6 when we believe that a split year group would not be helpful. In Year 6 we split the 45 places over 2 separate year 6 classes. This ensures class numbers stay low but the Year 6 children are not mixed with any other year group.
For example if your child is in Year 1, they could be placed in the Year 1 or Year 1/2 class. Please refer to our curriculum map to see the topics covered in each class.
Understanding autoimmunity in complex regional pain syndrome.
A short research progress presentation by PhD student Serena Sensi who is based at the University of Liverpool, supported by the Pain Relief Foundation (PRF)
The PRF approached Serena to give a short presentation of her work “Understanding autoimmunity in complex regional pain syndrome” conducted at University of Liverpool under the supervision of Dr Andreas Goebel, to our Trustees at our Trustee meeting held in December, to which she very kindly agreed. Serena was given a time slot of 10 minutes to make her presentation which she took in her stride and was not phased by the added pressure, Serena went on to deliver a very thorough informative presentation and was thanked wholeheartedly by the Board of Trustees for taking the time out of her busy schedule.

© Amusing Planet, 2017.i cannot deny the love that the Father has for me. i am precious in His sight and He wants all of me. the love He has for me is so overwhelming and so powerful. He created me – He created me with his own hands for his own purpose for me to be able to LOVE him and experience HIS love forEVER. i cant even think of the words to describe the love i am feeling in this moment, as i sit in my room waiting for my next class. nothing can take his place in my life, nothing can satisfy me more. i give everything to him – all of my heart, all of my intentions, every emotion, every desire, every groaning, i give it all to him. i give it all to him. i give it all to him. what the Father does in our lives is greater than anything we can want for ourselves and it is so worth it, to give up everything for him. it’s so worth it, to lose everything we desire and gain everything in HIM. i can think of no better way to live my life. i cannot live my life any other way.
I find myself in a daze, in a maze, of confusion and hurt
I find myself lonely and with a feeling of such abandonment
I look around me and I see that my whole life is changing what what is left of me?
Does anything remain?
It’s stupid. It’s pathetic – that I let myself get this way…
I’m living a life, better than I was so many, many days ago –
I’m no longer high
I’m no longer drunk
No longer do I find that corrupt, unsafe love
I once was lost but now I’m found
No longer living in disgust –
of myself for being found pass out unconcious on the bathroom floor,
of myself for going beind my moms back just to get a little high, just to get a little buzz…
I have finally settled for so much more, and now I dare say that I feel deppressed and alone?
When my soul has been completely restored?
I’ve finally found a reason, a purpose, my destiny –
to serve the One who created every single part of me,
I need to wake up – remind me, My God, what disaster you saved me from!
Remind me of the days I felt worthless and ashamed – remind me of the days when they called me disgusting names,
remind me of the days when I serve a god named destruction and remind me of the days when I had a reason to cry,
I now serve a God of strength and of might, who fills my soul more than anything I’ve ever tried…
I live a life in the arms of the One who created it all, of the one who was hung on a tree for me,
the One who will fight and trample every evil one for me,
the One who came and set my soul so free…
the One who yearns and desires for my heart,
the One who is ravished by one glance of my eye,
I serve the One who gave his life for me, who bled and profusiously so he could one day have me,
I dont have a reason to feel this way,
because of you – I am redeemed,
because of you real love my heart has finally seen.happened at mass earlier…
2015 is almost over. How’s that? Well, my year in twenty fifteen was quiet a roller coaster ride experience and journey of joy, excitement, disappointment, confusion, lost, blessed, and so many emotions to tell. It started to be dramatic since I wasn’t able to get the job at DepEd after all the long wait and hope I put in for that opportunity which led me to disappointment and asked myself what’s next for me then.
Even though learning experience happened to me at the early months of 2015 I was blessed and be part of Mindanao Unity Games (NorthMin) which composed of the different chapters of the community I joined in,Ang Lingkod Ng Panginoon. The said annual sports fest participated by Butuan (the host chapter), Valencia, Malaybalay and of course the Cagayan de Oro. The long hours of ride of butt and back pains are worth it because I did enjoy from the games, the food, the place, the fellowship and meet up of different, new and old faces of brothers and sisters in the community. The three-days stay was truly a remarkable and unforgettable memory that I will forever cherish and bring to me all the days of my life.
On the same month of MUG came the Day of Renewal or the renewal of commitment of the brothers and sisters in Ang Lingkod Ng Panginoon. It means we vow before the Lord and before the brothers and sisters to fully love and serve Him through committing the way of life as a Lingkod committed member. I was reminded of my three letter word (Y-E-S) to the Lord that I shall only love, serve, obey and follow only Him and keep to myself the promises and plans of the Lord to me even how hard it is to be at His side and live out the very life that He wanted me to live. That being a committed member it’s not always like a second venue, fellowship and/or bed of roses but a narrow road towards His Kingdom, seeing Him face to face and worshiping Him together with all the saints, martyrs, missionaries and the people who loves Him.
Of course the following month, June, started our Sister’s Household. We, sisters of 7: Haidi (coordinator/admin), Heidee, Bless, Camille, Melai, Nichole and me, lived under on one roof for three weeks. Household activity for me is always a life changing and a metanoia experience for me because I get to discover, recollect, assess, evaluate, reflect and deepen my relationship with the Lord. Plus, I also get the chance to know and build a deeper relationship with other sisters. We were benefited and blessed by sponsors and donations especially in food and other expenses in the house. What amazed me most was that it’s my 3rd time to join in a sister’s household and 3 weeks of blissful stay it’s like God is telling me that He’s in control over my life although I’ve been overwhelmed with clouds on my mind and doubtful heart.
Then I went back, again, to tutorial which I was never been happy and satisfied for so many reasons. Which lead me to ask myself if ever I’m really into teachings? Should I find other career? That, I don’t know. May God enlighten me and show me His path.
July 16 marked my fascination to Alden Richards and Maine Mendoza aka Yaya Dub in short ALDUB of Eat Bulaga. These two made my year even more exciting, giddy, happy and mixed emotions. They taught me to patiently wait and joyfully appreciate what I have right now. I believe the Lord wanted me to learn through KS that everything happens in the right time at a right reason. I should also do my part and my best to achieve certain goals in my life. Me and my God work hand in hand. To let go and let God do the rest of the work.
My Christian Sexuality Course, CYA Anniversary, Lingkod Christmas Party, Minchu’s goodbye, my brother’s promotion and recommendation,my high school reunion, my family, my relatives, my city, my friends, my country, my life and my God—these are the things my 2015 made of.
2016 you’re next.Dooley: Tell me a little bit about yourself. Who is KS Augustin?
Augustin: First off, thanks for hosting me here, Diane. KS Augustin is essentially a mongrel. I got called that at school and it’s true. I’m a mix of Asian and European genes, mores and cultures, which would drive anyone crazy…so I decided to start writing instead! So far, it’s kept me sane. Well, relatively anyway.
Dooley: When did you start writing and why?
Augustin: I could say that I think there’s a genetic component to the writing bug. Not the whole thing, but definitely a component. The Augustins have been known to be writers and I suppose I follow in a couple of my ancestors’ footsteps. I “published” my first story in Primary-6 when it was included in the school’s annual magazine. It was a bit overwhelming having high school seniors coming to me in class and asking if it was okay to include my story in the magazine! I still remember that feeling of primary-school terror mixed with pride and excitement. The story itself was a little crime tale, which I haven’t really written since. Hmmmm, something to think about. Thanks for the prompt, Diane!
Dooley: You’ve lived in many countries. How has all this globetrotting affected you as a person? How has it affected your writing?
Augustin: I started out as an Army brat, so I was used to moving around from a young age. I think that’s now translated into a low boredom threshold when it comes to surroundings so yes, we tend to move countries the way other people might change houses. How it’s affected me is by showing me just how similar everyone is. Sure, the outward trappings may be different, and there may be certain culture-specific ways of expressing emotions or ambitions, but the underlying human psychology is the same. We all want to be loved, we all want to be appreciated, we want to help our family and friends. Those things don’t change, no matter what country we live in.
This is a very important part of my writing, I think. It gives me hope that I can, for example, set a story on an alien planet and yet everyone will be able to relate what the protagonists are going through. In other words, globetrotting has filled me with a kind of warm glow towards humanity…as long as I stay away from the news.
Dooley: Of all your published works, do you have a personal favorite?
Augustin: My personal favourite is always the last release! Then, six months down the track, I’ll be wondering why I didn’t do this or that and my next release becomes my favourite. Writers can be fickle like that.
Dooley: What do you feel are your strengths and weaknesses as a writer?
Augustin: Hmmmm. That’s an interesting question. Strengths? I think I’m a good writer. A couple of my editors have called me a “precise” writer and I like that. Weaknesses? I turn out very jerky, very choppy first drafts. Sometimes, when I’m going over my drafts, I’ll think to myself: “What the hell was I trying to say here?!” I’ve also got to curb my tendency to go adverb crazy. And, every novel, there’s usually a word or two that I seem deeply attached to. Luckily, editors have picked up on such over-use and have hit me over the head with it, for which I’m eternally grateful.
Dooley: Who are your favorite authors and why?
Augustin: Yeah. Right. I don’t really have any favourite authors. It’s like having heroes. I don’t have any of those either. (I subscribe to the Pappy Boyington philosophy on heroism when he said: Show me a hero, and I’ll prove he’s a bum.)
So while I admire Doris Lessing and what she tried to do with the Canopus Archives, I think it got a little too “smart” for me in places. I like some of Iain M Banks’ work but, lately, he’s degenerated into unedited tedium. I’ve always had a lot of respect for M John Harrison but he lost a fan with his treatment of the female characters in “Light”. Richard K Morgan turned out a brilliant debut with “Altered Carbon” and then I think he took the path of least resistance with “Market Forces”. I’ve been a huge fan of Lois McMaster Bujold’s Miles Vorkosigan books, but I think she phoned it in with “Cryoburn”. Do you see what I mean? There are individual books that I think are great but, just because a couple of books are good, doesn’t mean that I consider the author one of my “favourites”. Nobody’s on auto-buy. It also depends on my mood. Today, I might be in the mood for a Vonnegut; tomorrow, for a LeGuin or Lackey. It all depends. Incidentally, my favourite colour is grey, so make of that what you will!
Dooley: What books are on your current to-be-read pile?
Augustin: I’m going through a number of Ellen Datlow-edited anthologies at the moment and having the time of my life! They’re great! In addition to that, I picked the three books off my bedside table to answer this question and, besides Datlow, they are: “The Outsider” by Colin Wilson, “The Cowards” by Josef Skvorecky, and “Beyond Growth: The Economics of Sustainable Development” by Herman E. Daly. I’m also waiting on “Engineering Infinity”, a hard sf anthology edited by Jonathan Strahan, that I ordered recently from The Book Depository.
Dooley: Your latest release is War Games. What is it about?
Augustin: Laisen Carros is an undercover agent for the Fusion. She’s been sent to Menon IV to essentially lose a war without making it appear that she’s losing a war. The problem is, she’s done some questionable things in the name of her mission and thinks she’s beyond redemption. Her rationalisations are growing thin, she’s got personal demons from her past she still hasn’t dealt with and she’s starting to wonder if there’s any difference between her and the people she’s supposed to bring down.
Just as she’s going through all this self-doubt, Lith Yinalña comes along. Lith is everything Laisen isn’t. She’s idealistic, passionate, energetic. She believes in things. And part of that impassioned belief is the task to kill the person Lith believes Laisen to be. So you have two people on opposite ends of the spectrum, if you will. And much to each other’s dismay, they start falling in love with each other. But, of course, this doesn’t happen in a vacuum. You have all the politics and machinations of the military structure thrown in as well, so it’s a case of double- and triple-think, as Laisen tries to get out of this whole mess alive. How will she do it? That’s what you have to read War Games to find out.
Dooley: You’re self-publishing War Games. What prompted that decision?
Augustin: I was offered a contract by a well-respected small (print) press for the novel and ended up walking away because several of the contract clauses were ludicrous, in my opinion. War Games got shelved. Then, last year, self-publishing became the major topic amongst writers, agents and publishers. And I thought: hey, why not? I contracted professionals early this year to do the cover art and editing and here I am!
Dooley: What does the future hold for KS Augustin?
Augustin: The thing about self-publishing is that you have to commit to the hamster-on-the-treadmill work ethic. As a general rule, it looks like you have to have steady output for two or three years before anything starts to pay off. So, by publishing War Games, I’ve essentially locked myself into a particular groove for the next three years. I’ve got a pure space opera due to come out at the end of this year (Quinten’s Story) and another one, and a cyberpunk thriller, planned for 2012 (Genesis: Republic Diplomatic Corps and Overclocked, respectively).
I’m also writing an urban fantasy series under the pseudonym Cara d’Bastian. I started this project at the beginning of 2010 and then I just dropped it and walked away when I read about Cindy Pon’s difficulties with her books, featuring a minority protagonist, and the white-ing of covers, and so on. Under such circumstances, there just didn’t seem to be any commercial potential for a UF series set in south-east Asia with Asian characters and south-east Asian mythologies. Well, when self-publishing came up, guess where my thoughts led? 🙂 The first book in the series, The Check Your Luck Agency, is currently back with me after some pointed comments from my Developmental Editor. It’s due for release in October, with two more books planned (Return of the Hantu and Night of the Pontianak) for release next year. It’s going to be a head-down-bum-up, as Australians like to say, three years. We’ll see whether it pays off.

Augustin: Thanks again for having me here, Diane. I hope I didn’t piss off too many of your readers. 😉
Thanks again for hosting me, Diane. I’m here if anyone has any questions…..
You always give such interesting interviews, KS (and Diane, you always find fun guests!). I think it is so exciting, the opportunities opening up to authors and readers, with this brave new world of publishing. Was it hard to become your own publisher? What did you find the most challenging about the process? What did you like about it?
Oh, I love adverbs too! I sneak in as many as I can, then grieve when my crit partners make me ax them. LOL
Great interview. I own In Enemy Hands but haven’t started it yet. Looking forward to it!
I love what you said about “…set(ting) a story on an alien planet and yet everyone will be able to relate what the protagonists are going through.” Relating to the characters is at the heart of any good story, but moreso, IMO, in SF or F. The Otherness of the world an author builds can be as out there as you can imagine, but when it comes down to it, the reader wants to relate to the characters.
Great interview! And congrats on the release!
Love the cover of your new book.
Your philosphy about heroes and authors is the way I am with music. I like a lot of songs but there’s no one artist whose every song I like.
Hey there Pauline! Sorry for the late responses, everyone, but it’s about 7am here for me. I’ve been sleeping while all of you have been commenting.
Great questions Pauline. Because I’ve started and run my own businesses for years (from an IT consultancy to a bookshop to a gym and martial arts’ school), the move to being my own (micro) publisher wasn’t a difficult one. From not having my own venture for a few years, it was actually very comforting taking that on again. The most challenging aspect hasn’t gone away and that’s the abject fear as you near the end of a project. It struck me with WAR GAMES, the day before I began uploading to various etailers, and I just know it’s going to strike me every single time since. Have I done this well enough? Is the cover art perfect? Will readers even like the story? What I like is what I like about running all my previous businesses–the control and the ability to say, “This is all mine and I’ll stand or fall by it.”
Groan Bella! Welcome to the Adverb Overuser Support Group. We should have a logo or something. LOL You’ll want to read the sequel to IN ENEMY HANDS and it’s not written yet. (I’m not being egotistical here, just a friendly warning.) Sorry about that.
Cathy, congrats on your release as well! Yes, I believe this is one way that SF can really improve. It’s about time we showed the kids with gadgets that “relating” can be more important than a loving description of “inertial dampers”! (Not that I don’t like inertial dampers, but balance…there needs to be balance!)

My name is Bella and I’m an Adverb Overuser, but there’s nothing wrong with that. LOL

Bella – KS speaks the truth for In Enemy Hands needing a sequel. It’s a terrific read, though. I loved it.
Pingback: War Games is released! « Sandal Press Blog
Hey Anna, how did you sneak in there? 🙂 You’ve given me the opportunity to plug the wonderful, the versatile Valerie Tibbs of Tibbs Design for the fantastic cover! I’d recommend her to any author in a heartbeat, except I don’t want to get muscled out when I need my next cover done! LOL
That was my fault. Didn’t notice Anna’s comment awaiting approval. Sorry, Anna!
Too late, Kaz! I’ve taken note of Valerie Tibbs name. War Games is far and away my favorite of your covers.
Hee hee. Wait till you catch the NEXT cover! It’s for an end-of-year release called QUINTEN’S STORY. I’ll put the cover up next week.
I read the teaser for Quinten’s Story that followed War Games on my Kindle edition. It had the cover, too, but in black and white. I’m looking forward to seeing it in color. And damn, woman, I cannot wait to read the rest of the story!
Re: War Games. I loved the little scene break thingummies you used. Very effective. Thoroughly enjoyed the story, too. Glad you’ve got a backlist. That’ll help while I’m waiting for Quinten’s Story to be released.
Yeah, that’s the problem with e-ink. At the moment, b&w is the rage, which is a bit of a shame. After a disastrous experience with my first e-ink reader (the display began fading within 18 months), I’ve chosen LCD devices ever since. I have to charge them more often (once or twice a week) but I prefer them, esp. as I do most of my reading in bed at night.
Thanks for the comments on the “thingummies”! LOL That’s all part of my evil branding strategy for Sandal Press. Glad it appeared to work.

The appellate court affirmed Lucas County Common Pleas Court Judge Frederick McDonald's April 22 decision. Both courts agreed that Madrigal's consecutive life sentences were imposed properly and that he did not have a right to withdraw his pleas.
Sentenced in January, 2007, to two consecutive life terms, Madrigal was convicted for the aggravated murder of Larry Loose, a dishwasher at a Maumee restaurant, and the kidnapping of six others. He was also sentenced for the 1996 aggravated murder of Misty Fisher, who was shot during the robbery of a KFC at South Avenue and Anthony Wayne Trail where she worked.
In an agreement reached after a federal appeals court overturned his death-penalty conviction for Miss Fisher's death, Madrigal avoided the death penalty and was sentenced to 126 years.Pond Installation in Mt. Airy, NC
A small pond is a treasure trove of life. You’d be surprised at the diversity of organisms that take up residence in a mud puddle. A few common animals come to mind – frogs and turtles in particular. But the close observer knows that there are many species of ‘bugs’ that quickly colonize a small body of water. Living, breathing, moving things fascinate children (and some of us who have kept a hint of that child-like wonder alive). They stimulate curiosity. I’ve watched students light up at the sight of a bird or a bug. If a school can have a few niches of natural habitat that attract wildlife, doors can open to new avenues of exploration and learning.
Mike Dunn and I had the opportunity to work with students and teachers at Jones Intermediate School in Mt. Airy, NC to install a minipond (or water garden) on Thursday, June 2. It was part of a two-workshop series the Museum’s Outreach section offers called “Creating Schoolyard Habitats.” First, we meet with the teachers and demonstrate ways to use their habitat in the classroom and what they will need to do prior to habitat installation day. Then we work with students to install it. Back in April we had our session with the teachers, who ‘got their hands dirty’ exploring the world of aquatic macroinvertebrates and pond plants that we brought in. Yesterday, students literally got their hands dirty – leveling, backfilling, and potting – as part of the installation of their 100-gallon in-ground minipond.
Four groups of students joined us in the courtyard behind their school for about 30 minutes each. Each group helped with one aspect of the pond installation. The first group stayed dry as we checked to make sure the pond was level in its hole (thankfully, the assistant principal’s husband did most of the digging!) and then backfilled the gaps around the pond. The second group helped to fill the pond with water (and they didn’t spray each other with the hose!) and to measure the proper amount of dechlorinator for their pond. I was very impressed with the 3rd graders use of multiplication and fractions! The final two groups helped to re-pot the plants for the pond – white water lily, blue flag iris, horsetail, pickerel weed, and golden club. As with all our projects, we provided native North Carolina plants for the school. The plants will provide shelter for the organisms that move into the pond, and most produce flowers that will be attractive to pollinators.
In addition to helping with the hard work, the students also closely observed some critters that might find their pond and move in! They used dichotomous keys to identify things like predaceous diving beetles, water boatmen, tadpoles, and damselfly and dragonfly nymphs. And they were wise enough to know how those critters will get to their new pond – frogs will hop there to lay eggs, damselflies and dragonflies will soar in from the air and lay their eggs, and adult beetles will fly in from nearby locations. As is our custom if the school is in a different county from where we collected the critters for observation, we didn’t add any living creatures to the pond. And we encourage them not to add fish to the pond. A fishless pond supports a greater diversity of life than a pond with fish. Over the next year, the students will get to watch as their pond grows up and is colonized by myriad living things. And it can be a source of inspiration, curiosity, and learning for years to come! Check out the museum web site to see how your school can get involved in similar schoolyard habitat projects.Pleasantly surprised that ST editor allowed “Qatar: Big lessons from a small country” to be published.

In Kishore’s “LESSON NO. 1: SMALL STATES MUST ALWAYS BEHAVE LIKE SMALL STATES“, he highlighted Qatar’s “one big mistake”, ie it believed that it could act as a middle power and interfere in affairs beyond its borders because it “sits on mounds of money”.
Isn’t this similar to Singapore which has almost $1 trillion?? in state reserves and CPF mostly invested in foreign assets? Isn’t PM Lee talking big because Singapore has “mounds of money” and not because he has any substance?
Kishore then went on to praise LKY and said he “never acted as a leader of a small state”; LKY “had earned the right to do so because the great powers treated him with great respect as a global statesman”.
Kishore then tried to put it subtly across to PM Lee: times have changed and like father, not like son.
Kishore:
Kishore was referring to the South China Sea not-family dispute in which Singapore has taken sides. According to a SCMP article, “Beijing believes the island state has been playing both China and the US cards to advance its own interests.”
Perception counts and if PAP continues to live in denial of its mistakes, Singapore will suffer. PM Lee is ultimately responsible for lowering our international standing. PAP should remember that small states must always behave like … small states.
The takeaway for me from Kishore’s article: PAP/PM Lee kena slapped. 🙂
This wise guy can sleep with anyone so long as he gets paid handsomely. Its very typical of so-called Singapore academia and intellectual elitists serving LKY’s interest.Author: Akansha Saxena

The national composite posted an increase of 7.3% for 2012, while the 10- and 20-city composites reported annual returns of 5.9% and 6.8% in 2012. Month-over-month, both the 10- and 20-city composites moved into positive territory with gains of 0.2%. Nineteen of the 20 metropolitan statistical areas posted positive year-over-year growth, with only New York failing to make the grade.
‘Home prices ended 2012 with solid gains,’ says David M.

A final environmental impact statement by the State Department concludes that building the Keystone XL pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution.
The President said last year that he might approve the controversial 1,700-mile pipeline if it did not “significantly exacerbate” the problem — a standard that would seem to be met. The next step belongs to Secretary of State John Kerry, who must recommend a course of action to Mr. Obama.
The administration owes everybody a decision. It is long overdue. Canada, which wants to export oil from the tar sands of Alberta to the Gulf Coast, is frustrated. Environmentalists and petroleum interests are also anxious.
The environmental position puts Mr. Obama in a great quandary. Just because the report says the pipeline doesn’t worsen the carbon pollution problem much, that doesn’t mean there isn’t a problem.
He wants to wean the nation off fossil fuels, but he is being asked to facilitate their greater use, via an energy-intensive extraction process.
A refusal to build the pipeline would not do much to curb global warming. The crude oil is going to be extracted and used, either bought by China or shipped by rail to the United States.
While environmentalists fret about the threat of pipeline ruptures, oil pipelines already cross the country without most Americans noticing. Not so tanker trains, which have threatened or caused environmental catastrophes recently, some in highly populated areas.
No matter what it decides, the Obama Administration will face criticism. The right decision, although admittedly a tough one, is to approve the pipeline.
The nation’s interests would be served by further reducing America’s dependence on Middle East oil, and by the creation of 1,950 construction jobs to build the project over two years.
As for climate change, this issue presents a special case. Mr. Obama can heed St. Augustine, who famously prayed for the Lord to make him chaste — but not.Here’s your chance to Play Santa with Laurel Hill’s Holiday Stocking Stuffers!

Thursday 2 June
12.00-1.30pm in Room 3.318
This week Eirini Apanomeritaki introduces a discussion of myths of the afterlife in
E. Fakinou’s The Seventh Garment.
Paul Klee (1879-1940), The Messenger of Autumn (1922), Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut, USA [work on the public domain]
Often seen as a retelling of key events of Modern Greek history with mythical elements, Eugenia Fakinou’s The Seventh Garment (1983) narrates the tragic story of a family through three female narrators: Mana, the mother, Eleni, the daughter, and Roula, the granddaughter. The three generations meet when the last male member of the family, Fotos, is dying and an ancient pagan ritual is about to be practiced to ensure his entrance to the Underworld. According to the ritual, the blood-stained garments of former male members of the family must be placed around the dying man, so that the ancestral spirits guide him to the other side.
Fakinou’s magical realist text revives ancient myths, the most prominent being that of the loss of Persephone, pagan beliefs and funeral rites which are also juxtaposed with Christian faith, and modern views on customs and rituals of the Greek countryside. The women’s internal monologues reveal their own painful experience of history but also how the Modern Greek state was founded upon a combination of myth, folklore and religion.
Eugenia Fakinou, The Seventh Garment, trans. by Ed Emery, (London and New York: Serpent’s Tail, 1991), pp.98-113.
See our poster, the extract from The Seventh Garment, and a blog entry for some additional information on Fakinou’s magical realism.Tomorrow begins the Foundations of Western Herbal Medicine, where we learn not only about the medicinal wonders of herbs like spilanthes, but also about human health from the lenses of traditional and modern Western medicine as well as Native American, with foundations that help us to ‘cultivate the healer within’, the name of Clearpath School of Herbal Medicine’s first-level program.
Under-the Radar Herbal Medicine Superstar: Summer’s twilight here at Clearpath Medicine Gardens. It’s been a year of struggle with the lack of rain, at least for the annuals; but not so with spilanthes. Although half-buried under a sprawling cucumber, it is holding its own, it’s robust, succulent stems, leaves and flowers showing no distress from the summer’s drought. In a garden filled mostly with hardy perennials, spilanthes is an annual (to this agricultural zone; it is a perennial in its native, subtropical South American range) we never do without. It is also one of the lowest maintenance plants in our garden: easy to grow, hardy, pest resistant, generous and diverse in its medicine, unique in beauty and flavor/sensation (tasty addition to salads), and both a conversation starter and stopper. It quietly appears in more of my stock formulas than any other herbal medicine in my apothecary.
Sex! Male Aphrodisiac! Testosterone! Herbal Viagra!: Do I have your attention? Don’t take my word for it. Do a simple search and see what turns up? In studies (with rats, mostly), spilanthes rivaled Viagra in most categories tested, and its effect improved and became more enduring after 28 days of use. So it has a build-up effect. Independent to those physiological mechanisms, it also increased testosterone levels. Alkamides constituents may mimic testosterone or stimulate its secretion, as well as increase erection endurance via relaxation of blood vessels. As a male aphrodisiac herbal medicine, I predict it will soon become a celebrity.
Ageless Beauty! Wrinkles Be Gone! Better than Botox: Can an herbal medicine be a superstar in two areas more obsessed over than almost anything else by people, and still be unknown? In the case of spilanthes, I guess so. In the world of natural and healthy anti-aging skin-care products, spilanthes possesses anti-wrinkle properties, acting as a fast-acting muscle relaxant that speeds the repair of wrinkles and strengthens and tones collagen.
Toothaches Gone! Saliva On!: Spilanthes is a local anesthetic, with an affinity for numbing the mucus membranes of the mouth. In its native range it is commonly known as the toothache plant, for its ability to quickly relieve tooth pain. Also, chewing any part of the plant — especially a flower button — quickly induces a strong, unique mouth sensation, one that is not always enjoyed. It numbs and relaxes while simultaneously triggering a dramatic tingling sensation and a profuse amount of salivation. It can make it difficult to speak for a few moments. Ironically, it is a key ingredient in my Performer’s Throat formula, helping to invigorate qi flow, circulation, and stimulation to the throat and voice box tissue.
Spilanthes does much more, and actually, I have not even mentioned the primary reasons why I use it so much, but that will have to wait until another blog. And if you live in the area and are a last-minute decider and still want to join the Foundations of Western Herbal Medicine class, which begins tomorrow, September 28, from 5:30-9:30, there i still room.Recommend

So when any Faro resident goes to Olhão he can still view with a particular fascination the magnificent landscape of the islands, the marshes, the fishing boats, the setting of the sun below the distant horizon - it’s an ever changing scenario that feeds those feelings that touch our Atlantic souls.
The blessing that enhances this essential part of Olhão’s identity has shaped its population as they contemplate the boats and the tides from the dockside, the terraces and the belvederes.
So, it is with indescribable incredulity that I see the latest project from Olhão Council which translates into a desire to completely ruin the view from the city’s riverfront by extending the marina used for pleasure boats.
This marina, which already is a shameless size that covers half of Olhão’s waterfront, is to continue its expansion from the current site to block off the view from the fish market with a second phase due to expand into the area near the pier where the island ferries dock.
This is the will of the mayor, to shut out the timeless backdrop of views over the Ria Formosa.
It's not so surprising if you look at the history of this city. About 25 years ago in a television interview, the maestro Almeida Vitorino stated that Olhão had been considered possibly the most beautiful city in the world, but on his last visit he was shocked to see that terrible changes had occurred. The conductor noticed the deep mischaracterization of many houses with 'bathroom tile' exterior finishings, aluminum frames glittering in the windows and doors, and uncared for buildings everywhere.
Olhão invariably appears (or appeared) in reference books and international compilations on vernacular architecture alongside the most important places in the world with its carved lime recesses and mysterious medinas, it was the charming muse of João Lúcio and Artur Pastor among many others, this masterpiece of form, light and colour, has, over the years, deplorably been stripped of its character, bastardized and mutilated, without mercy, under the baton of successive Council presidents who have demonstrated ignorance, insensitivity and an enormous lack of good sense.
Also, the strong population has not known, when facing the totalitarian dictates of fashion, how to defend their culture and their ancient values.
And so we come to this ridiculous and shameful situation in which, at this point, the people who are standing up for the integrity of Olhão, its architecture and its culture, are almost exclusively the foreign community that has settled there in recent years.
Let us list some of the official contributions to the disfigurement of Olhão:
• The ruination of the Avenida da República, once a charming and romantic thoroughfare, but now with numerous beautiful houses and palaces demolished;
• The state of disrepair and decrepitude of many houses and old factories which are lining up to be demolished, as has already happened to many of them, which, for their architectural importance, would in any other civilized country be exquisitely renovated;
• The calamitous state where the historic districts have been left without character and where the only intervention that has taken place was the introduction of pedestrian finishings and contemporary fittings at odds with the whole area, with the exception of half a dozen houses renovated by foreigners who have returned to the era of whitewashed walls and wooden windows and doors;
• Permission to build additional floors on front line houses so the view from many terraces further back in the city has been blocked;
• Permission for the construction of the Real Marina Hotel and the adjacent apartments to the west, with a volume and an architectural style that is incompatible with the unique urban fabric of Olhão.
Finally, and sadly, we have to add one more barbarity in this pitiable litany of incompetence, ignorance and lack of love for patrimony: the extension of the recreational marina - a boa constrictor that will slowly suffocate the stunning views over the Ria Formosa.

9 Responses to “The Music of Pixar Live! Dining Packages Now Available”
Can an AP discount be applied to one of these dining packages? Also is there any indication whether you’re limited to a set menu of options with the package or if the full menu is available? Thanks!
I’ve never done this package, but I’ve done the Fantasmic package a couple times before at Mama Melrose’s. You have access to the full menu, plus specials. Just pick any of the apps, entrees, and desserts. It’s really a fantastic deal with the dining plan.
Thanks Dan! If I’m not mistaken, it seems like it could actually be a better deal than dining without the package, depending on what’s ordered. $49 filet plus $11 app plus $10 dessert comes out to a great deal for only $65! I’m planning to book Brown Derby but just need to call WDW and verify if the AP discount is applicable.
Any idea of the running time of the concert?
It’s 40 min., per the disney website.
Also, I just called them to book this and the guy on the phone said that the performance is closer to 20 minutes. That was important to know since I signed up for the 8:15pm performance with the 9pm Fantasmic performance. He said that they specifically designed it that way so people can go from one to the other.
I couldn’t find both Pixar and fantasmic on the Disney site so just signed on for Pixar live. I spoke to Disney and was told you can use your dining plan table service credit. But would like to know how to sign up for both shows. Doing dinner at the Brown Derby. Thanks
Are fast passes going to be available for the music of pixar? anyone knows? can you just get in line or is it only with a dinning package? my fast pass window will open soon and want to plan ahead and accordingly.
Are there any plans to extend this to the fall? We are going in October and would love to see this show.Have you ever had a colonic? Many people swear by them, and I regularly refer patients to a colon therapist. I’d like you to keep an open mind when it comes to this form of therapy and try to understand the benefits you can get from this amazing treatment. Colonic therapy is something a lot of people would never consider as a treatment and it is certainly not a therapy supported by mainstream medicine. But it is important to remember that mainstream medical doctors regularly prescribe antibiotics and do not believe in the concept of a candida yeast infection either. Colonic therapy is a very valid form of therapy and if you go to a professional person you need not be embarrassed either. I know of several colonic clinics in both Australia and New Zealand that have been treating patients for many years with excellent results, especially those who have had chronic digestive issues for many years.
Why Colonic Irrigation With Candida?
Having a colonic makes sense if you have been suffering with a yeast infection, especially a chronic one. Colonic irrigation is a great way to get the most out of your Big Clean-Up; it will assist in loosening and removing any unwanted and hardened fecal matter from your large intestine. This treatment will ensure that there are virtually no places for the yeast to hide in your large bowel, and give your digestive system a clean foundation. If you are considering colonic irrigation, then a colonic cleanse is best attempted now before you start on the Candida Crusher Diet. I have seen less noticeably less aggravations during the candida treatment phase in those who have a colonic at the start compared to those who didn’t.
What Am I Likely To Expect With Colonic Treatment?
Your colonic therapist is a person who is experienced in this area. Be sure to enquire how much experience he or she has had, and it is important to enquire which professional colon therapist association your therapist belongs to.
A treatment session lasts anywhere from 30 – 45 minutes, and the patient initially will have a nice relaxing abdominal massage in the lower stomach area. This helps to loosen any bowel plaques or accumulated matter that the colonic irrigation treatment will help to expel from the body. After the massage, your therapist will insert a small disposable tube into the rectum through which warm water is passed into the colon. You may find the first treatment a little strange, but you soon get used to it. The water is expelled after, along with any loosened matter. The best way to find a therapist is to ask your local health food shop, or go online or look in the yellow pages. I recommend anywhere from one, two or even three treatments during your cleansing week, but your therapist will best be able to guide you on the frequency of treatment.I started writing poems in my teens and I was one of the few who didn’t stop. I started doing spoken word in my late twenties.
In between those times a lot of things about the Canadian poetry scene put me off my food: I couldn’t find one poet who had anything good to say about any other poet. It was weird … this ferocious competition and backbiting for what seemed like so few places at the pinnacle of Canadian poetry, and for what? What was at the pinnacle? Were there even readers? Was there any reward so worth it that poets would rip each other’s throats out to get it?
The answer is a simple no, there wasn’t. The infighting was awful because the rewards were paid in that worst of currencies, perceived prestige. No one read poetry. The year I started doing spoken word the person who won our Governor General’s award for poetry had sold three hundred copies of her book.
That statistic made it clear that if somebody didn’t do something, poetry would become a dead art.
So in Montreal we started playing poems on the radio station CKUT 90.3 in the same way DJs played songs. Poets started appearing in the top 40, then in the top 10, and finally, less than three months into this project we called Wired on Words, a poet usurped the musicians and hit number one on college radio.
Then along came this roar from the US of A: the poetry slam. Teams of poets from cities all around the US were competing onstage for the title of best performance poet of the year. Vince Tinguely wrote a column on spoken word for the Mirror weekly, and you could find poets working beside musicians in clubs around the city. The CBC ran nationwide spoken word contests.
And the scene now? Straddling the end of March and the beginning of April this year we put on the 3rd annual Mile End Poets’ Festival, a five day festival featuring spoken word, music and dance by performers from across Canada. On the same weekend Kalmunity, a music ensemble that regularly features poets onstage, was celebrating the 10th anniversary of its performances in the city. The show I host and curate, the QWF’s Words and Music Show, has presented poets, musicians and performers every third Sunday of the month for over twelve years at Casa del Popolo.
Lately, you can also catch the Throw Poetry Collective’s monthly slam down the street at Divan Orange.
This fall twenty-four teams of five poets each from cities throughout Canada will be landing on our streets as Montreal hosts the annual Canadian Festival of Spoken Word in November.
But the most unbelievable cross-cultural impact is on YouTube, where Shane Koyczan’s most recent poem To This Day has over eight million views. Tanya Davis, who performs at our Casa show, has another poem, How to Be Alone, that’s been seen and listened to over five million times.
I got into spoken word because I saw it as a way to sidestep all the infighting over definitions of what’s poetry, and instead, to help create a bigger scene for poets.
To a large extent this has happened. Fans of poetry are no longer just specialists in esoteric literature. (I love these specialists deeply. I love anyone who has a shelf full of poetry at home. You can invite me for dinner anytime.)
And the poets themselves have found a much larger arena. One performed at the Olympic opening ceremonies in Vancouver. It’s just something we do here.
Ian Ferrier is a Montreal poet and performer. He is the founder of Wired on Words, a spoken word record label, of the Mile End Poets’ Festival and of the online performance review litlive.ca. His most recent CD, with the band Pharmakon MTL, is entitled To Call Out in the Night. You can hear it at CBC Music. You can watch him perform on YouTube or in Montreal’s One Man Band Festival on May 26th.

Great piece Ian!!! Inspiring.
What don’t I get? Is there a secret connection between the title and the article? Or none? A way to get attention? Am I supposed to figure this out on my own – like, who cares if the title has no connection to the article? Still I wonder. Is there s secret connection between the title and the article?

A time of transition can be a stressful one for many business owners, especially when involving the ownership transfer of a company’s assets or stock.
During this process, a purchase price allocation is often obtained to assist both the buyer and seller in the allocation of the purchase price for both tax and financial reporting purposes. The two allocations are similar in many respects, but there are some key differences to understand. Given
these differences, it may be beneficial to involve employees from both a company’s financial reporting group and tax group in the valuation process. This joint effort can create synergistic savings for the company in relation to the scope of the valuation analyses required subsequent to a transaction. Without coordination amongst these groups, each group may end up completing separate valuation analyses, which is costly and potentially inefficient from a tax and financial reporting perspective.
A recent court case helps to highlight the benefits of pre-planning, coordination, and engaging a valuation professional at the time of the transaction to perform the tax and financial reporting purchase price allocation. In Peco Foods, Inc. (“Peco”) vs. Commissioner of IRS (“Commissioner”), both the U.S. Tax Court, and, upon appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, agreed that for depreciation purposes, Peco could not unilaterally change its original purchase price allocations made in two asset purchase agreements entered into when Peco acquired certain assets at two poultry rocessing plants.
The background of the case is as follows:
After revising its asset purchase agreements and original tax allocation schedules, Peco applied for a change in accounting method with its 1998 tax return in order to adopt a different method of depreciation for its revised asset allocation schedules. Upon doing so, the Commissioner issued notices of deficiency to Peco, disallowing the retroactive adjustments in the allocation schedules.
After petitioning the U.S. Tax Court in response to these notices of deficiency, the U.S. Tax Court agreed with the Commissioner that Peco agreed to, was bound by, and could not modify, the original purchase price allocations set forth in the asset agreements, in order to obtain more favorable tax benefits.
The U.S. Tax Court found that under I.R.C. § 1060(a) where parties to an asset acquisition agree in writing, as to the allocation of any amount of consideration, or, as to the fair market value of any of the assets transferred, that agreement is binding on the seller and buyer, unless the Commissioner determines that the allocation or fair market value is not appropriate. The Commissioner did not dispute the propriety of the original allocation schedules, thus, the U.S. Tax Court only analyzed the enforceability of each agreement upon Peco.
Both agreements contain the statement that the original allocation shall be used “for all purposes (including financial accounting and tax purposes)”. Peco argued that both agreements were unenforceable because certain terms used (“Processing Plant Building” and “Real Property: Improvements”) were ambiguous and did not encompass certain assets that would be treated as different property classes for tax purposes. The U.S. tax court found that both contracts are enforceable as unambiguous, and Peco is bound by the original allocation schedules and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the U.S. Tax Court’s judgment by stating that in binding Peco to both agreements, the Commissioner can be assured that both Peco and the respective sellers treat the assets consistently for federal tax purposes.
While Peco was determined to be bound to the original asset purchase agreement for tax purposes, a company in Peco’s situation may not be bound by the asset purchase agreement for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, while an agreement based on the allocation of assets in a purchase agreement may bind a company for tax purposes, it is typically not binding for the treatment of acquired assets for financial reporting purposes.
The issues described in the Peco case are entirely avoidable if proper pre-acquisition planning and coordination takes place. Pre-planning may also provide a company with synergistic cost savings if a purchase price allocation for tax and financial reporting purposes can be performed together. By consulting with a qualified valuation expert with experience in business combinations and a wide range of financial reporting and tax contexts, a company can better understand the specific issues with regards to the allocation of a purchase price for both tax and financial reporting purposes.

since i am so close to french culture and i'm constantly visiting this damned country / speaking this damned language, i thought i would do a lil post about french style, highlighting paris specifically. parisian style is world renowned for being chic and beautiful, looking amazing without even trying, having a few key classic pieces, etc. quilted chanel bags and réalisation are fine and good, obviously, but they're quite boooooring. and i still think the root of french style is a beautiful, classic femininity dating to pompadour and earlier. (coco chanel is probably rolling in her grave-- whatever, she was a nazi anyways.)
i mentioned femininity briefly in one of my previous posts -- basically, i am a Huge Fan of the over-the-top femininity in fashion, as exhibited by like, this whole fucking blog -- but some of my favorite examples recently are duh, molly goddard (especially when suzie bubble wears her, oh my god), also that miu miu collection that basically changed my life. i wanted to bring these sorts of elements back to parisian style.
so here's me, making a fool of myself and freaking out all the french mamies who were just trying to get their morning baguette, for god's sake.

If I look at some of the circumstances that have unfolded in my life, I could go both ways as to whether or not I might have one. I’ve done incredibly stupid things and lived; I’ve had incredibly terrible things happen to me, and I suffered because of. But to believe in a benevolent angel who loves me unconditionally sounds intriguing. Even though I perceive a childlike essence to believing in such a deity, walking around a grocery store or sitting in a meeting thinking that my angel is somewhere near, looking out for my best interests, could be a great source of spiritual alleviation. So why don’t I believe for the pure purpose of making life a pinch easier mentally and psychologically?
This kind of philosophy is not new, and in a roundabout way has been coined by a famous man named Blaise Pascal. Utilizing the prospect of an actual spirit world in conjunction with the message of the Bible, Pascal suggested that one would be better off believing in God, abiding by the good book, and believing in Jesus, all for the sake of getting into heaven, as opposed to what the Bible proposes as an alternative.
The problem I have with this is that deep down, I can only “want” to believe. Like Fox Mulder from the X-Files, I do, I want to believe. And I really want a guardian angel to be in my life. However, I don’t understand the intense, self-contradictory issue of sitting in a church and pretending to believe for the sake of going to heaven, when in fact, what I’m really doing is lying to God by pretending to believe. Would God want this? Would he want me in church pretending to believe? Going through the motions could be rigorous and aggravating after a while, not to mention the fact that virtually every prayer I’ve ever prayed has never come true. I wouldn’t say my prayers were for greedy things, either, I had just kind of hoped for some things that just never materialized. If I should have been praying for “God’s will” the entire time, well then obviously, whether I prayed for it or not, God’s will got done regardless of the prayer.
While the notion of burning in hell for all eternity doesn’t sound pleasing, this threat by the Bible doesn’t exactly help my issue of believing. Catholics believe in Purgatory, a place where people don’t necessarily go to hell, but they’re not in heaven yet because they have to do jail time for the sins they’ve committed, because they’re not glistening enough to be in the presence of the Divine. Maybe that’s where I would go; that is, if I were Catholic. But since I’m not Catholic, the fates of the spirit world must have another plan for me.
Getting back to Pascal, I think the idea is a bit shaky. “I don’t believe, but since I’ve got nothing to lose, I may as well.” But how this works comes in handy for the person who needs a higher power, a person like me, to help alleviate the torture of the drab situation of life. The alternatives are mental doctors and mind altering substances, neither of which are very thrilling to embrace. But if I choose to believe in a guardian angel for the sake of acquiring a romantic and heavenly analgesic, exactly what is it that I have done? I’ve participated in the perpetuation of a societal mindset that has haunted the earth for centuries; I’ve gone and perpetuated the myth I have. Should I care? Freedom of religion allows me to believe in whatever I want, but the ultimate problem I have is the inner turmoil that ensues whenever the thought of believing in something intangible arises: since there is no way to ever know whether such a spirit world exist, how can I participate in the worst possible lie: the lie that is the one to thyself. Would I be lying to myself, or deceiving myself, or would I just being going out on a limb in deciding that whether or not guardian angels exist, it doesn’t really matter, as long as I’m helping myself to survive. Is the intellect more important than the spirit? Is the point of being correct about atheism more important than believing in the love of a guardian angel?
The human spirit possesses such a wide range of emotional texture that even the most hardened souls can be touched by the thought of being unloved. So maybe a discipline of thought can be employed to help one believe despite one’s disbelief. Where would that take us? Would it matter?
If one were gaining a healthier outlook on life and attaining a measure of peace, then I would say yes; and if, by believing, the institutions of man’s interpretation of the spirit world, a.k.a. the Bible, the Quran, etc., are perpetuated in the process, I would also say yes, it does matter.
In the meantime, I would love to meet my guardian angel.
Had you only known the wonderful woman that was my grama. Now, she has had her stroke and is unable to speak. Before that, she gave each of my daughters a plastic angel on a ribbon, to dangle above whatever, with a printout that explains how to contact your guardian angel. She says she was quiet, cleared her mind, and her angel spoke her name. I can’t remember what it was. It was some old lady name. But I WANT to remember, because I know when during my weekly visit, speaking the name would bring a smile to her face. I haven’t yet followed the protocol as dictated by the printout to my daughters, on how to listen and meditate to hear the name.
During my adolescent and suicidal years, I would conjure the image of myself, in white with pigtails resting with security and comfort in the lap of the pure white omnipotent God. This gave me great comfort. It was a safe harbor. Placebos are placebos, and belief is more important than reality or proof at times.
Not to rattle your quest into completely unshakable territory or anything, but things like this leave me utterly speechless:
hiya!
I would’ve loved to have met your grama, these stories of guardian angels are totally adoring, and I could use me a ribbon with a printout to listen I could.
This post, on the contrary, is disgusting and perverse; we’re both lucky to not have known people like that, but the point being that how can God exist in these terms? It’s not a mystery to me.
My position on placebo believing is undecided as of yet, but yeah, sometimes I have images of curling up, then I wake and I’m curled up with my pillow, lol.
Hoping things are well for you and your family back home over there dear friend.
Hi, LK – Your musings here remind me of the round-and-round arguments in college philosophy.
I have moved from Catholicism, believing in God as Guy in the Sky and angels and the Devil, to agnosticism. I rather like the idea of angels, particularly guardian angels. While there is no definitive proof of God or angels or devils, what belief would make you happy? One of the sociologists my husband studied said that God is merely what human beings decide s/he is. Create your own idea of God. I prefer the idea of God as The Force from Star Wars.
Life can also be satisfying without having a belief in any sort of god. My uncertainty over whether there is an afterlife makes me very determined to live this life to the fullest right now. I might not get another chance. There are plenty of marvelous, miraculous things in our universe to celebrate.
Mary, …the Force. Very Good. Please make a post with a youtube video when you’ve gotten to the point of levitating objects. : D
Actually, the “Force” idea is not far off from Wiccan theology.
I might adopt a guardian angel so long as I don’t equate her too much with an imaginary friend (scary), but really, I’m liking the idea of moment-to-moment to the fullest, a frame of mind I’m leaning toward more and more. The days go faster and faster.WHAT HAPPENED: Plaintiffs were detained at Guantanamo Bay following the September 11th terrorist attacks. Plaintiffs assert that they were detained illegally and without sufficient evidence warranting their detention, and are suing the government officials they believe are responsible for their detention.
WHY IS THIS BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT: Well, for starters, the detention of enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay was a clusterfuck from the beginning. In the years that followed 2001, George Bush and friends were routinely in front of the Supreme Court trying to justify detaining suspected terrorists without Due Process. In every case, the Supreme Court found in favor of the detainees, stating that the foreign terrorists are not entitled to the full Due Process protections entitled to citizens, but they are entitled to something. This case takes a different angle than those cases, as these Plaintiffs are not seeking criminal constitutional rights, but are instead looking for civil damages as a result of those actions, as the Plaintiffs argue that the government officials in question knew what they were doing was wrong and detained the Plaintiffs anyway.
WHAT ARE THE RAMIFICATIONS – Suing the government is tough sledding, because the deck is stacked against you in the form of qualified and sovereign immunity. In all cases, the government cannot be sued unless it consents to be sued, and as you can imagine, the government does not like to be sued that often. For these defendants to be found civilly liable for their actions, the Plaintiffs have to prove a fairly high burden of showing that the Defendants knowingly violated their Constitutional rights and that the general rules relating to false arrest and imprisonment should apply to this fairly unique situation. Should the Plaintiffs’ claims succeed, it could open the door for similar lawsuits against high government officials related to the War on Terror, or HYPOTHETICALLY, a certain order by the President that knowingly bent Constitutional rights and inconvenienced a large group of foreign citizens in the name of protecting Americans from terrorists.
ROOT FOR ASHCROFT IF: you’re down with early 2000s nostalgia, like Brittany Spears, foam mesh trucker hats, and widespread paranoia about Middle East terrorism.
ROOT FOR ABASI IF: you watched that one episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver about Guantanamo Bay and now you feel like an expert.
PREDICTION: Ashcroft 4-2 (Kagan and Sotomayor are recused)IPAS2 System – Get Leads for the IPAS2 System
If you simply signed up for IPAS2, or you’re thinking about enrolling in IPAS2, you are questioning, “How to get leads for IPAS2?”.
This is such an essential question so I thought I would address it.
There are numerous ways to get leads, or prospective buyers, to the IPAS2 system.
Where should you start getting leads?
And exactly what is most effective to obtain leads for IPAS 2?
This short article addresses methods to get leads for the IPAS2 system so you can begin making cash.
IPAS2 | The best ways to Get Leads for IPAS 2.
Here is a list of methods to get leads for the IPAS 2.
Facebook Posting, and Interaction or Prospecting.
This is a fantastic free approach to obtain potential buyers. There is training on how to do this inside the IPAS2 training. Pretty cool!
Generally there are 2 primary methods of creating totally free leads within Facebook that have shown to be efficient.
The first method is to publish to Facebook groups. The majority of marketers simply post their affiliate link with some copy to a Facebook group. I find a more effective way is to post links to your blog posts, and then the blog posts have calls to action at the end of the article … after providing LOTS of value.
The 2nd totally free approach is starting conversations with individuals on Facebook, or in other words prospecting. This takes more effort but it is far more effective than posting links in Facebook groups. I have utilized this method a lot and it works.
Facebook PPC
We discussed complimentary Facebook list building, so the next step is to discuss spending for clicks using Facebook (PPC, or Pay Per Click). I love Facebook PPC due to the fact that you can focus with laser accuracy in on your target customers. This indicates you’ll be putting your offer right in front of certain purchasers. If you target your ads to speak to your audience you’ll get more leads, and therefore more sales.
It is extremely advised that when you do Facebook PPC to have a free offer to entice individuals to offer you their e-mail address. I do not send them straight to my IPAS 2 offer … instead I such as to collect the emails first before sending them to the IPAS2 capture page. It is very important to obtain those emails since leads typically require an average of seven direct exposure before they purchase something.
YouTube Promotion for IPAS2.
I love video.
Video is a GREAT methods of both promoting and branding your products and yourself. With video people to get to know and trust you. You will begin to link with your target audience as you show that you are a REAL person.
We submit videos to YouTube on a regular basis. These videos can then be discovered by Google or the YouTube online search engine. We’ll also imbed the videos into our blog site posts. I likewise advise submitting the exact same videos to your Facebook page if they are five minutes or less.
Consist of a minimum of one link in your YouTube video description … ideally in the very first line of the description. Doing this will make sure that the link appears in YouTube search engine results page as a clickable URL. You can have your video link take individuals to your blog, a post, the root of your webpage, or a capture page. Explore different kinds of links … mix it up some. If the video is likewise embedded in an article then I will have the link going to the blog site post to show audiences where they can get more details on the video … then on your blog present lots of opportunities for them to decide into your subscriber list.
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Your Blog.
When asked, “ways to create leads for the IPAS2 system?” I will certainly inform them my favorite method is to use SEO.
I love SEO. As soon as when you have on and off page SEO completed for a page or article, you can basically forget it and proceed to the next page or article unless it is an extremely competitive keyword (those require more upkeep).
Let’s say that gradually you get about 2 visitors a day per post (which is low if you are doing SEO correctly). After one year of consistent daily blogging you will certainly get 730 brand-new visitors a day! I am getting about 1-3 % of visitor traffic recorded as leads … so that would imply you could be gathering typically approximately 7 to 22 leads a day! And those pages will continuously produce those leads as you include more content the following year.
The SEO technique of getting leads is the sluggish way. That will keep bringing people on your list back to your web site (which will certainly increase your general traffic to your web site) so you can attempt and get them to buy.
And if you carefully choose great keyword phrases for each post, you should have targeted traffic on your site that have a much better opportunity of desiring to buy something.
In addition to our article, I develop “money pages.” These extremely focused web pages generate particular, laser targetted traffic to our website. Normally these pages target harder keyword phrases and so I have to develop a lot more backlinks … but they can be worth it. As I write this I am getting in between 250-350 visitors a day simply for our IPAS 2 money page. Imagine what you can do if you have even 10 pages that brought in even 25-50 visitors a day … targeted visitors who are extremely near buying … and you will rapidly understand the power of SEO.
IPAS2 Traffic Coop.
The IPAS 2 system consists of the capability to purchase clicks to your offer to your IPAS2 capture page. This is a fantastic way to get begun buying traffic for IPAS.
I like the IPAS2 system’s ability to assist you track where your clicks are originating from and whether those leads join your subscriber list or pay for the trial. This has assisted me to weed out poorer traffic sources. You can utilize this function yourself if you head out and buy your very own traffic.
Parting Words About How to Get Leads for IPAS 2.
There are a great deal of other ways to obtain leads, but this are the ones I feel most comfortable discussing.

Vermont is one of our favorite escapes- beautiful landscapes, crisp fresh air and some of the warmest people ever. On August 25th we packed the car and drove up to Burlington, located on the shores of expansive Lake Champlain. It was the 4th annual A Dog Day, a weekend long event of skateboarding, music and camaraderie that since its beginning we’ve never missed.
Video filmed & edited by: Brian Adamkiewicz
Andy A Dog Williams was a talented DJ, skateboarder and snowboarder from Burlington. He influenced many people with his style & smile- and after a tough battle with Leukemia, his spirit lives on strongly. His genuine approach to life positively affected a range of people globally amongst the action sports, music, as well as the local Vermont community. The Friends for A Dog Foundation was started in his honor and provides arts education to the less fortunate, and hosts an annual memorial event. Andy’s partner Jozie works arduously to continually share his spirit with others, and awareness about Leukemia treatment- signing up us and hundreds of others to be bone marrow donors.
Saturday began with a group hill bomb, from the top of UVM all the way down to Lake Champlain. It lasted about 15 minutes of steady cruising as over 50 skaters rode through the entire city of Burlington. Once by the lake, everyone amassed at the brand new Andy A Dog Williams Memorial Skatepark, a concrete paradise designed by Grindline and built by Artisan. The turnout was incredible, and contests kicked off all afternoon for kids of all ages. Even the Mountain Dew team came through with Sean Malto, Curren Caples, Chris Coburn and Jordan Maxham to really put on a show!
His genuine approach to life positively affected a range of people globally amongst the action sports, music, as well as the local Vermont community.
Afterwards, the Friends for A Dog Foundation hosted DJ and vinyl workshops, breakdancing classes and live painting. The festivities were just beginning, as shows and performances started from 7pm till 2am! Nectars is a centrally located local venue with two floors of stages. The lineup was packed with DJ’s, musicians and performers- with a special show by the legendary BeatNuts!
We spent the weekend camping with all the homies just up the road, on the beaches of Lake Champlain. The rest of the weekend we explored the city and enjoyed what it has to offer. Burlington has so many spots to skate besides the park- Theres an abandoned freeway onramp overgrown with vegetation and intact jersey barriers for the entire length of the road. Over the years locals have added tranny, banks, pump bumps and wall rides making it a really fun and diverse place to skate. Across the train tracks is the Burton Headquarters that has a perfect skatelite bowl tucked away against the treeline and always generates a heated sesh. There’s even a perfect marble plaza, privately owned and built in the middle of the mountains and forrest.

Huge thanks to everyone in Burlington for showing us such a great time! Much respect to the community and everyone involved in continuing ADog Day- its one of our favorite gatherings, already looking forward to next years! #thankyouskateboardingThe Group 3 Queen Of The South Stakes is due to run at Morphettville Racecourse on Saturday April 28, 2012.

ID Fest begins
A quick reminder to all movie lovers in the Midlands.
Derby’s first film festival, ID Fest, launched last night at Derby QUAD, offering a fascinating twist on the usual festival experience in that everything is themed around the notion of identity. As announced at the launch, the intention is a biennial festival, each time tackling a different type of identity: for 2010, it’s the thorny question of English identity.
Over the next three days (Fri 26th – Sun 28th) they’re screening some of the greatest and/or more intriguing English movies ever made, from classics like Olivier’s Henry V and Get Carter, to modern hits like Control and Made in Dagenham, both of the latter including Q&As with their respective screenwriters. A side-project, ‘England From Above,’ tackles some of the many great English movies directed by foreigners, including Repulsion, Blow Up and Children of Men, the latter of which I’m introducing on Sunday night so please come along to that, at least!
Things kicked off last night with a panel discussion that brought together professors, film archivists and a bona fide English acting legend in David Morrissey. Put five people, plus a moderator, next to each other, and you’re never going to get any concrete answers about what it means to be English, but instead we got a suitably thought-provoking, freeform discussion about all aspects of national identity. There was enough food for thought to keep one feasting for months, with the panel demonstratig a refreshing humour, insight and candour throughout.
Subjects included (amongst other things) regional accents, racism, WW2 movies, whether the “English” are distinct from the “British,” and whether commercial movies can ever cope to represent the complexity of national life as well as television, theatre or literature.
This latter aspect provoked the only misstep of the night, as some idiot in the audience asked whether the remaking of English classics (specifically Morrissey’s TV classics Blackpool, State of Play and Red Riding) diluted English identity by using “more marketable actors.” Morrissey, with instinctive Scouse wit, quipped back, “Oh, ta very much for that,” and showed up the guy in the audience for the complete tool that he was for being so bloody stupid.
I’m not saying who that person was… but you can read between the lines, right? Suffice to say, he’s suitably ashamed of himself.
Apart from that, the evening was a resounding success, and in a strange way made me feel proud of being ‘English,’ without all those horrible far-right connotations getting in the way. Things culminated in a screening of The Third Man, the “greatest British movie of all time” (as voted by the BFI, anyway..). A proper review of that will appear here in due course.
In the meantime, get yourself down to Derby and enjoy some of England’s (or Britain’s, or wherever’s) greatest movies.

I thoroughly enjoyed most of the evening. Your remark along the lines of 'high profile' actors going on to replace original cast members must, on reflection, have made you cringe! I felt Professor Cecile Wright looked very uncomfortable and in my opinion was the poorest contributor who did herself no favours by politicising every topic covered. A talented and knowledgeable panel otherwise and I wish ID Fest every success. Quad definitely enriches Derby. Christine Kilby

Study on data citation policies for research data
In this article, a small-scale case study analysing the nature of data citation policies within the scope of longitudinal studies in life course research is presented. The sample consists of eight data providers from Europe, North-America and Australia and was evaluated with regard to eight criteria which potentially affect data citation behavior of researchers in the field, for example the wording of data citation obligations or sanctions for not citing research data in accordance to given requirements. The study demonstrates that research data providers follow a wide range of approaches to data citation, especially in terms of data citation location within a publication as well as disposal obligations for data-related publications. However, this diversity might lead to inconsistency in data citation behaviour and also to a general lack of comparability of data citation quantity and quality as relevant factors in research evaluation.

The Power Train and Comprehensive Extended warranty schemes, valid for a period of five years will be available for customers of the Hyundai i10, Santro, Getz Prime (petrol), Accent and the Verna versions.
The Korean car maker says that the schemes will ensure Hyundai cars owners to avail maximum warranty for their cars with minimal cost implications. The Comprehensive Extended Warranty scheme is a complete protection scheme for the car, covering mechanical, electrica, and other parts including the engine and transmission, for a period off five years or 100,000km whichever is earlier.
The Power Train warranty, is ideal for customers who do not want a full comprehensive warranty covering the entire car. The scheme will cover the engine and transmission parts at a minimal cost for a period of five years or 100,000km which ever occurs earlier
Hyundai Motor India, seniro GM, customer care service, HMIL, B Mani said ''It has always been our endeavor to provide innovative products and service to our customers which suit their needs and lifestyle. And this Extended Warranty Scheme will only add to the levels of customer satisfaction for our customers and emphasizes our commitment to our values and products.''
Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Company, South Korea, is the second largest car manufacturer in India. Currently, HMIL markets 30 variants of passenger cars across segments, including registered a total sales of 327,160 vehicles in 2007, an increase of 9.2 per cent compared to the previous year. In the domestic market it accounted for an increase of 7.6 per cent with 200,412 units, as compared to 2006 while overseas sales grew by 11.8 per cent, with exports of 126,748 units.Word counts can be a contentious subject for writers, with some being very word count orientated and very detailed in their record keeping while others are “whatever” with it, so long as they know the end number for the finished work.
Me, I am a bit of an obsessive when it comes to word counts and any sort of record data for my books. It is all part of my training and former life as a geologist when data management was vital on big projects like motorways and so on. There was just so much of it, one had to keep good records.
This has spilled over into my writing management and is part of the many tips I provide in The Handbook Of TOP TIPS To Manage Your Writing, now available in Kindle and paperback on Amazon.
For any book I am writing I create a new spread sheet with the following headings
Chapter Title Words Total Words Pages Total Pages
It is then a simple case of inputting the data and you have a chapter by chapter page and word count ready for any publisher or agent to have whenever they want it.
There are easy ways of using the cells to add the correct data together so that if you make changes, the maths is done for you rather than sitting there with a calculator re-adding the data.
It keeps you disciplined and keeps tabs on what ever you are writing.
For my current book, The Truth I had to add in a few lines here and there to make something consistent all the way through the book and every chapter changed by a few words, adding 647 to the final total. It is so much easier keeping this data on your spread sheet and if you are like me, you can make a short cut to your computer desk top so that it is always just one click away.
Keep writing, for you know you have to….
I don’t keep track of my word count per chapter, but rather of how much I do in any given writing session. I total up the words I have and see how many that is since the last session. It also lets me check against my “ideal” word count number to see what sort of percentage I am through the book.
I might start to break it down per chapter so I know which ones are clearly too short, and which might need editing down to keep an even balance in chapter lengths, as best as possible.
Thanks for the feedback Gary
I am also a bit of a word count per session freak and set myself 1500 per time/day. When I am in full flow I can get well over 10,000 a day, so keeping count per chapter and per day is something I do
keep writing

The main reason that House leadership would not want a fight over defunding Obamacare was that it might scuttle chances of passing a continuing resolution, and thus bring up the prospect of a government shutdown. “They want desperately to take the idea of a government shutdown off the table,” says Salmon of the GOP leadership. “That message has been resonating loud and clear.” Although Salmon, who was in the House in 1995 during the last such fight — doesn’t want a shutdown, he nevertheless believes it “might be the only leverage we have with Obama to get to what we have to do, which is entitlement reform.”
For his part, DeSantis believes that if the GOP signals that it will do anything to avoid a shutdown, it will have little leverage to enact significant reforms. Obama, too, has something to fear from a shutdown, DeSantis suggested, if the public places some part of the blame at his feet. “If we don’t have a shutdown, that’s great,” DeSantis said. “I’m not advocating one. But at the same time, I’m not going to act like that would be the worst thing ever.”
“I don’t think we should ever take it off the table,” added Salmon. “I don’t have a trigger finger, where I’m itching to pull that trigger. But the fact is, we should never, ever say that all options aren’t on the table.”
House leadership sources did not respond to a request for comment.Whilst it's only a month since I made the move to uni, it is arguably the most difficult month (dissertation aside, obviously). I often forget to do life updates on my blog and normally I just stick to makeup and fashion and that's about it. However, I'm the type of person that likes to know everything there is to know about bloggers and YouTubers and I think by habit I share more about myself on my YouTube channel just because it's less edited and seemingly a lot easier. But as uni is a topic that terrified me for a long time, I feel like it's something I really want to talk about.
So, just to give you some context about my university life. I moved down to uni on the 4th of September from my little seaside town of Scarborough to Epsom, which is about half an hour South West of London. I study fashion journalism which can't come as the biggest shock as I've been writing my fashion and beauty blog for a good few years (rubbish as it may have been in the beginning).
So as I seem to have survived a week by myself, freshers week, induction week and the start of my course, I feel that this would be a good time to have a chat about how to get through it successfully (with minimal crying).
Now, don't get me wrong, don't get it twisted, I did not find the first week the easiest by any means. Leaving home, my boyfriend, my friends and my parents was one of the most rubbish things ever... but it does get easier. I remember when I first slept in my little room in my halls I sat the whole night questioning whether or not I'd actually made the right decision and whether it was worth feeling this sad all the time. I definitely could not imagine ever feeling settled and happy being this far away from everyone I love. However everyone around me was in the same boat, feeling even more rubbish than I was and I found myself telling them a week later that it actually does get easier. And it totally does.
It's still not great to be away from everyone but after a few days you get to know the people on your course and in your house, you go out a few times with everyone and then you realise it's not actually that bad.
My biggest pieces of advice are just to not put pressure on yourself to feel great about uni straight away, it does take time to settle in- especially if it's your first time away from home; and- FaceTime your parents or boyfriend or dog everyday if that's what helps you.
Enjoy freshers week and get to know your lecturers as well as possible.
Good luck.
You will never know how proud we are of you. We love you and will always be there for you no matter what.
Good luck Fran, going out into that big wide world is always frightening and everyone goes through it but it becomes the norm in such a short time you will wonder what there was to be afraid of. I remember you the first few weeks of your life your mum and dad were so proud of you, I remember holding that little bundle in my arms you were so cute, look at you now a lovely young lady starting out in that big wide world on her own. Always follow you on facebook to see how you are going, very pleased to see your blog today. Good luck again Fran but I am sure you don't need it. Lots of love Yvonne Saltmarsh. PS Give my love to your mum and dad. xx- .
The 2017 first half volumes of DP World.
DP World CEO Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem said, ,:Princess Amelia lay down to sleep, savoring the day.
She recalled the details with delight. And why wouldn’t she? It wasn’t everyday that one was crowned a princess!
She had been unable to sleep the night before. The small rectangle of light coming from the slightly-ajar door was comforting. As were the shadows that flitted across it a few times. She knew she was safe.
Yet, something disturbed her and she had kept tossing and turning all night.
The next morning, Madame Orth had loudly bustled into the room at the first hint of dawn, followed closely by the dainty Monsieur Befort. They both seemed very pleased as they called out to her to rise and shine. She could barely open her eyes and wasn’t able to suppress a yawn.
Both the adults beamed at her and told her all about how she was a princess!
They were sorry for her lack of rest but the night had been a small test. Her restlessness proved that she was the lost princess. They had been searching for her for years and now they had finally found her. They were so, so happy. What a good turn of fate! The gods were smiling on them for returning the true princess of the kingdom to them!
But they mustn’t dally. Oh no, there was no time. They had so much to do! Come on, up, up, up!
And before she could take another breathe, she was whisked off for a tour and an introduction to everyone and to bathe and have her hair done and her face made up and dress. She went up the stairs and she went down the stairs. She shook hands and she curtsied (after Madame showed her how it’s done). She held in her stomach as they tightened a corset around her waist. The soles of her feet hurt as she was made to try on dress after dress after dress and walk in heels as high as she was herself!
Madame finalized a mauve dress for her, offset with lots of pearls and diamonds. The clothes felt luxuriant against her skin and made up for how uncomfortable her hairdo and shoes were and the jewelry scratched her.
She was really grateful once the feast was underway. Now all she had to do was sit in the high chair in the middle of the room and observe the festivities.
Everything around her twinkled immaculately, including the guests. As Madame introduced them, they deferentially bowed to her. Raised their glasses and toasted the return of their princess.
Her heart had thudded really loudly in her chest when the time came for the crowning. The ceremony otherwise was boring, with lots of chanting. She barely heard a word; her eyes were riveted on the tiara sparkling in front of her.
Oh, that was her favorite part, the way it twinkled in the light! And she was sure she shone with it!
She sighed contentedly and settled deep into her soft bed, trying to find the perfect position.
First she turned to her right. No. It doesn’t feel right. So she shifted to her left. Nope.
Hmm. Maybe she should try lying straight on her back. Arms crossed on her chest. Or maybe arms up behind her head? She could just tilt her head a little. Okay, what about on her stomach?
But no matter what she did, Princess Amelia could not settle in.
She had been unable to sleep the night before. The door was closed today and no “comforting” rectangle of light reached her. No shadows flitted across the room. She knew she was safe.
At least, she felt safe.
But in her heart, she knew.
Tonight was also a test and something disturbed her but it was not the pea.
It was not the pea and she didn’t know what to do. It was simple, she had thought.
Only now she realized it wasn’t as simple as that. And now, it was too late…
So she kept tossing and turning all night.

The background is pretty cool and light which makes it easy for the readers to read. and the font is suitable too. I am adding this blog in my reading list. 😀 I wonder why I never came across this blog, Its a pretty little cute space.
Thank you so much, Ridx, for your kind words! 🙂Genus Allocapnia small winter stoneflies are common and plentiful in all of the streams that I visit: this genus isn't. This is the third or fourth time that I've seen it, and I've only seen it in two small streams in Sugar Hollow. These.
This is genus Paracapnia, species angulata. Too uncommon to have a tolerance value assigned.
On the wing pads -- the posterior ends of both pairs are rounded (the rear pads of Allocapnia are truncate). Paracapnia wing pads look like this.
But let's look at Beaty's description ("The Plecoptera of North Carolina," p. 8) before we go any further.
Genus Diagnosis: Nymphs 6-8 mm. Head with a purplish-brown reticulate color pattern; pronotum fringed with many long bristle-like hairs, longest at corners; body setose, with numerous long setae.
angulata -- Head pattern of purplish pigmentation outlining entire frontoclypeus, with a short bar from median ocellus to the anterior edge of the frontoclypeus; occiput usually with purplish bars along, but removed from epicranial stem to postocciptal margin.
The purplish brown pattern is clear from our live shots.
We should also note that if we find a Paracapnia nymph in our parts, we've found P. angulata since Beaty notes that "Paracapnia angulata is the only known species of Paracapnia in the southeastern United States." (p. 9)
Actually, the reason I went out this morning -- it was cold and blustery -- was to look around for more Uenoids (little northern casemakers). And I found them of course since they're plentiful at this time of year. This morning it was Neophylax consimilis.
N. consimilis does not have a tubercle on the head, but it does have clavate gills on the first abdominal segment. The setae count at sa3 (ventral) is 2-3. Here you go.
On occasion consimilis has a frontoclypeal pale spot -- like this
-- but in other cases the head is totally brown. Such was the case on the one that I found this morning.
Good fun, even in freezing weather.I had this for breakfast on Friday (which I count as a weekend- not having uni), Saturday and Sunday! it seems to be my current favourite breakfast. Porridge with raspberries, walnuts and agave. I used rice milk which I really like at the moment- it's by Vitasoy and I thought it was interesting that it's enriched with calcium from chickpeas! I also find the taste of the rice milk really palatable early in the morning- sometimes the smell of cows milk and even soy milk can be really off-putting I find.
On Friday morning I finally bought ballet shoes :) I feel like I'm six again!
Then in the afternoon A and I saw the movie 'The Trip' in Leichhardt, which was a lot funnier than expected! We had gelato beforehand and I thought this photo was particularly attractive (sorry A...)
On Saturday morning I got a lift to Rozelle, walked around for a bit then wandered around the markets. Being cold I almost bought a cardigan but when the sun came out there was no need. I did end up buying these shoes though which fit perfectly!
I made these carrot muffins when I came back from the markets, this time using soy milk instead of cows, using brazil nuts instead of walnuts and sprinkling chia seeds on top. I'll admit they weren't as nice as when I previously made them- but certainly that extra bit healthier ;)
On Sunday we celebrated my Grandma's birthday at our house with family, which meant a lot of cooking (and washing up!) in the morning. My uncle made these delicious spring rolls with a dipping sauce made of coconut milk, lime juice, fish sauce and chilli!
What I had for lunch: lots of roast veges, salad, pesto pasta (which I made!) and vegetarian biryani.
And for dessert apart from cake we made these baked apples, a recipe courtesy of Sophie Dahl. We'd never made them before and were impressed with how they turned out! The only criticism was a few sultanas on top were burnt, but oh well.
And that was my weekend! Let's hope this gorgeous sunshine continues :) :)
Have a fab week!

I find rice milk to be a little sweet tasting - which works really well for porridge!
All that food looks absolutely divine - baked apples, yum! I'd just pick the burnt bits off. :)
Rice milk really is perfect for porridge! It's my favourite one to use.
What a great sauce your uncle made for the spring rolls! I would never have thought of using coconut milk but now can't get the thought out of my head:)
woah your baked apples look amazing!
love the baked apples, looks colourful :)
Cecelia- Mmm it probably is the sweet flavour which I find appetising! And thanks, I did end up picking off the burnt bits, haha :) x
Sarah- Good to hear! It was a great sauce flavour wise with the coconut, I'll have to try making it! x

- Sarah Palin did very, very well at the start of the debate. She played Sarah Palin’s game, which was smart. If you can’t be better, be different — sometimes it’s just as effective.
- In the front end of the debate, when Palin spoke generally about the plight of the midde class and a system stacked against them, CNN’s somewhat improved Approve-O-Meter pegged out with positive feedback.
- When Biden talked about his own middle-class background, he likewise garnered strong positive feedback.
- When Palin talked about deregulation, the Approve-O-Meter showed a neutral or mildly positive reaction from the men in CNN’s focus group of undecided voters. The line indicating women’s approval usually plunged.
- Biden displayed his superior knowledge of foreign policy (and the issues in general) to great effect in the second half of the debate, while it was often difficult to discern an actual answer from the Alaska governor.
- In the second half of the debate, Palin stumbled noticeably. Her response to the question about what branch of government properly comprises the office of the vice president was vague, rambling and incoherent. She sounded like a beauty pageant contestant stunned by the glare of the spotlights. Biden, on the other hand, showed that he knows exactly what the vice president does and where the office fits into the constitutional structure of U.S. government.’
- I only saw Sarah Palin’s hands once that I remember. In that fraction of a second, I couldn’t tell what she held in her right hand, but she was squeezing it like she was trying to break it. How revealing it would be if we could see the hands of the debaters as well as their faces. People often are quite guarded with their facial expressions, while their hands provide a truer window to their souls. If you doubt this, the next time you interview someone or hold a one-on-one meeting, place a paper clip on the table within reach of the other person. Nervous people may play with it unconsciously and almost uncontrollably. Confident people may never so much as glance at it. Savvy people may move it out of the way before it becomes a temptation. It’s a cheap trick, but effective.
Overall, looking at the debate by itself, although I think Palin did better than expected, Biden did better still.
I’ll post a more substantive analysis Friday. in the meantime, read a complete transcript of the debate here.

[…] Okay. Who won? You know what I am talking about. Palin or Biden? Biden or Palin? […])

My husband grew up on the East Coast and has lived in Charleston, New Orleans and Texas. His first impression was “uh oh, she is coming across as an every-woman, one of us”. No-nonsense, direct, yet a bit folksy, and will really appeal to a lot of women in the South.

First, I’d like to preface all this by saying that things are generally great. There are no huge crisis that I’m wading through. I’m not planning to quit the blogging game or reviewing products in the foreseeable future.
It’s just that I’m generally busy. No, correction…make that absolutely buried. Between holding down two jobs and being a full-time single dad, it’s not easy finding a lot of time to grill, cook, taste new products, let alone write and podcast about them. A good portion of my daily meals are of the super-simple/quickie/fast food variety. I sort of envy those in the fiery foods blogging community with far fewer responsibilities, affording them to have a more prolific output. Don’t get me wrong; I’m more than happy for the terrific coverage they provide, but the (friendly) competitive nature in me wants to keep up, and it’s killing me to keep my spicy food projects on the back burner! LOL
And now, my main laptop is out of commission. Now before you start thinking anything, I’ve been prudent and have made regular backups; and I have a spare laptop ready to go, so I’m good there. But any of you who have dealt with similar circumstances know that moving to a new machine is not an easy or painless task. Not only is there the transfer of data, but there is also the setting up and installation of programs, setting up preferences from scratch, and the little “monkey wrench in the machinery” aspect of not having all the necessary software (at least immediately). With very little free time on my hands, this is easily panning out to be a week-long process.
When it comes to the Firecast podcast, I have a trio of GREAT interviews with some talented product makers coming up ahead: Dan Arnold of SuckleBusters, who produces some outstanding BBQ seasonings, sauces and more; Paul Sarris of Sweet Sunshine Sauces, who has concocted a lineup of genre-bending and category-blurring, all-purpose chili sauces; and the one and only Chad Lowcock of Race City Sauce Works, who is one of the utmost flavor geniuses in the food industry. Not only that, but chilehead blogger and regular Firecast contributor Ken Alexander have some juicy conversations recorded and ready to roll. Look for these to show up in the Firecast Podcast feed in the coming weeks, just as soon as the laptop situation gets remedied.
So in summary, I will be back and crankin’ out the goods at full speed at some point in the future. Until then, thank for your patience and stay tuned!Wednesday, May 7, 2014
BREAKING: Nasley Sommerville, Administrator at Southern Regional Hospital in Dangriga to appear before Public Service Commission tomorrow, Thursday, May 8th, 2014 to answer questions regarding Quarter Million Belize dollars siphoned from the Maternal Child Heallth (NHI) funds from the Southern Regional Hospital.
According to details gleaned from an audit report, Sommerville loaned $15 Thousand Dollars to Dr. Francis Morey, with whom she was having an extra marital affair. Sources say that when Morey repaid the money, Sommerville told him to pay it into her personal account.
Investigators have reportedly found accounts belonging to Sommerville at St. John’s Credit Union in Dangriga and another at Scotia Bank. The account at St. John’s was recently closed.
Sommerville has been on suspension and on half salary since this story broke in early October of last year.
CEO in the Ministry of Health, Dr. Peter Allen speaking with News7 Belize, last October said, “What they found was 3 cheques totaling $7,060 which were drawn from the hospital account which manages funds for NHI deliveries of babies at the hospital. They found 3 cheques totaling $7,060 w.”
“The preliminary report and copies of the 3 cheques totaling $7,000 have been forwarded to the Ministry of Public Service and to the Public Service Commission, recommending suspension of Ms. Sommerville from that office.”
“I also contacted the officer commanding the Dangriga division and Superintendent Joseph and I have sent him a copy of the preliminary report with a request for police and to consider intervening immediately.”
“Clearly we have a lot of searching to do because of clearly loopholes we had not been aware of and that have allowed something like this to happen.”
“My main emphasis now is to first of all make sure that we stop it and that it can’t happen anymore and secondly, that we do our best to recover what has been lost.”
No criminal charges have been filed against Sommerville. We’ll keep you posted on tomorrow’s interrogation.

A Culinary Tradition that Carries On for Centuries.
I loved snow during my childhood – nowadays not so much. I remember on really cold days my mom would always cook up some comfort food such as a green split pea soup. I don’t know if it’s just me who craves comfort food on cold days. What about you?
The funny thing is My wife comes from the Caribbean and she has a comfort food too. It’s a curry, whether it’s made with chicken, fish or goat. But it’s not cold there. So how do you define comfort food? Does it has something to do with the weather or our emotions? I would love to know your take on it?
What is comfort food and why do we love it so much?
According to The Free dictionary by Farlex the definition for comfort food is: ” Simply prepared food that gives a sense of well-being: usually foods with a higher content of sugar or carbohydrates, which can be associated with childhood or home cooking”. There we have it, what ever is in our comfort food gives us a sense of emotional satisfaction.
A study by the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University suggest that men crave comfort food during positive times while women yearn for comfort food in stressful times. Isn’t that interesting? What are you craving in comfort food?
Health Benefits of Green Split Peas
Split peas whether they are green or yellow are loaded with proteins and fibers. 95 % of all split peas come in dried form, which doesn’t diminish its health benefits. They are also packed with anti inflammatory properties and antioxidants. Studies have shown that peas in general have great health benefits such as lowering blood sugar levels, heart healthy, cancer fighting and cholesterol lowering properties, just to mention a few. For more info on health benefits on split peas follow the link. Linus Pauling Institute
Even though a split peas soup is loaded with “good” carbohydrates and calories I can say that this comfort food is quite healthy. Storm or no storm I will definitely stick to my comfort food as long as they are loaded with peas 🙂
- 3 slices bacon, diced
- 4 oz / 115 g butter
- 10 oz / 290 g / 1 1/4 cup organic green split peas
- 4 oz / 115g / 1 cup organic onions, finely chopped
- 4 oz / 115 g / 1 cup organic carrots, cut in 1/3 inch cubes
- 2 oz / 60 g / 1/2 cup organic celery, finely chopped
- 1 large organic potato cut in 1/3 inch cubes
- 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1/2 tsp oregano
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp mild vinegar,
- 2 1/4 cup water
- 3 cups organic chicken broth, low sodium
- In a stainless steel pan saute bacon over medium heat until golden brown.
- Discard fat and place bacon in slow cooker.
- Turn on slow cooker and time for 2 hours. Remember I used a rice cooker with a slow cooking option. The temperature of my slow cooker might be different than yours.
- Add butter, onions, garlic, celery and oregano.
- Saute until translucent.
- Now add all other ingredients stir once, close the cover and let cook.
- Give it a stir once or twice during the entire cooking process.
- Seasoned split pea soup with black pepper and salt if necessary.
So what comfort food are you craving?

THE Australian dollar is higher against the weakened greenback following more disappointing economic data out of the US.
At 0700 AEST on Friday, the local currency was trading at 94.15 US cents, up from 94.12 cents on Thursday.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic growth, rose a mere 0.2 per cent in May, official figures showed, while the US Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation remained subdued.
That followed disappointing economic growth figures released earlier in the week.
“The greenback was under pressure throughout the US trading session,” BK Asset Management managing director Kathy Lien said. “Even though St Louis Fed president James Bullard said the markets should be pricing in rate increases based on (Federal Reserve head) Janet Yellen’s recent comments, Treasury yields declined, indicating that investors are not convinced that the central bank is ready to tighten.
“We expect trading ranges in the foreign exchange market to remain intact.”Lilian Hobbs
Please introduce yourself. I am a computer database specialist which I entered by accident because a careers advisor heard about this new course called computer science. He didn’t know what is was, but thought it might be useful. The rest as they say is history. 35 years on and I am still working on computer databases. I have written books on the subject, presented at major conferences and travelled the world fixing some well known computer systems.
I love to travel and take photographs and when I am home I have some telescopes in a dome where I take photographs of deep sky objects like galaxies. Astronomy is my other big passion.
How did you get into motorcycling? I developed an interest in motorcycles, which were banned in our house, because I love to ride bicycles but was finding that I couldn’t go very far and I wasn’t as young as I used to be. Then I learnt that motorbikes got free parking in my local town and that made me find out how to pass the motorcycle test.
What bike did you first start? I bought a Honda CBR125R because that is the largest cc you can ride on a learner license in the UK.
Describe your current motorcycle. I am a big fan of BMW motorcycles which is why I have several. My K1300R is fast and heavy and I keep that for fun days out and when I am giving advanced motorcycle training. The BMW 1200GS use to be my touring bike until I rode across North America twice on a BMW 650GS. Its light and nimble but I still can’t pick it up.
Do you have a motorcycling achievement that you take pride in?
I hold the RoSPA Diploma in Advanced Motorcycle Instruction which is not easy as there is a half day of exams including a 90 min written test..
Have you done any long distance road trips?
Although I haven’t been riding for very long, I have done quite a few trips. My first was to Wales for the weekend which got me hooked, and then over to Belgium and Germany. Then it was around the South Island of New Zealand, down to Ushuaia in South America, across the Himalayas in India. I think my favourite was my trip across North America.
Crossing the USA twice was amazing as we met some lovely people and saw lots of amazing sites. The Alcan or Alaskan Highway is a great experience and I will never forget turning a bend and meeting a black bear and a moose. Before the trip I had heard about moose, but never seen on. In Alaska I saw 9 of them.
Lilian Hobbs in New Zealand
Do you have any motorcycling heroes? Not really but I do have a lot of respect for Lois Pryce because she doesn’t get sponsors and does it all herself without any support.
What’s your favorite motorcycling story? We stopped at a petrol station in Casa Grande in Arizona in the USA and a guy spotted our British flags and came over to speak to us. It turned out that he owned a motorcycle garage and when we told him that Wendy had lost the lid off her panniers he offered to make us one.
Watching Chuck make one from a sheet of metal was like something out of a reality TV show. He had never done it before and the photo of my bike being serviced with by this mechanic wearing a gun is one of the memorable photos of that trip.
Do you have any advice for people who want to get into motorcycling? One of my missions is to get more ladies riding motorcycles which is part of the reason I became an instructor. There are so few of us around and ladies often need to be taught slightly differently. My advice to ladies is to not be bullied into a big bike, get something you are comfortable with and if you are short get the Daytona boots which make you one inch taller. I swear by mine.
Start on a small powered bike and once you have confidence progress to something larger. Just remember you can do it. If you can ride a bicycle you can ride a motorbike.
RIDING IN THE UK
If I were to visit you and we went riding for one morning, where would you take me? I live on the south coast so it would have to be a run down to Swanage in Dorset for fish & chips. We would ride through the New Forest and take the Sandbanks ferry down to Swanage.
Our fish & chip restaurant is right on the beach and we get a great view of the Jurassic coast from the restaurant upstairs. On our return home, we would pass the remains of Corfe Castle, wind along the country lanes back to the Sandbanks ferry, before a ride through the back roads of the New Forest where we are sure to see some of the famous ponies.
What’s the best part about riding in your country? People may moan about the weather in the UK but we are so lucky that we can ride all year round and it’s not usually very hot or cold. We have a nice variety of roads and lots of great country lanes with lots of bends, oh and some nice scenery along the way.
What are the best months for riding there? It can be a bit cold, which usually means it’s freezing between December and February. I live on the south coast so we don’t usually get snow but further north it does snow in the winter.
How does the topography of the place you live in affect the kind of motorcycling you choose to do? There is little opportunity to ride off-road around me so my riding is on the tarmac. We do have a system of byways which are tracks where motorized vehicles may go. Unfortunately many of them are being downgraded to walkers and horse riders only.
Is it safe to ride at night where you live? Yes, completely safe. Many of the roads have good lighting.
Is there a local motorcycling event that you try and attend regularly? I belong to the local IAM (Institute of Advanced Motorists) group for whom I am a National Observer and we hold regular meetings with guest speakers and weekly rideouts. My RoSPA group also holds a monthly rideout and we have a café called Loomies, on the A272 which is often voted top road to ride where lots of bikes meet.
There is also the annual Horizons Unlimited meeting which I like to attend and present slideshows about my trips.
Are there any motorcycle specific laws?
In the UK you can ride a motorbike up to 125cc on L plates for 2 years if you pass your CBT, which is a 1 day course. Passing your test is a bit more complex as there are restrictions on what you can ride depending on your age. All riders must wear a helmet.
Are motorcyclists discriminated against in any way? I don’t think we are discriminated against but there are lots of drivers out there who don’t like bikers.
How do the police treat motorcyclists? I think we are treated the same. If anything, they may be nicer to you because many of them are bikers themselves.
Are any motorcycle related sports popular where you live and do women actively participate in them? The world class motocross track Matterley Basin near me attracts riders from around the world!
What is the traffic like and how does it affect motorcycle riding? The UK is a small island with a population of 63 million. Sometimes I think they all own a car. Traffic congestion is a major issue and our narrow roads often mean that even a motorcycle can’t get through. However, get away from the cities and we have lots of amazing roads with great bends.
How do car drivers treat motorcycle riders on the road? Some give way and make room and others deliberately try to block your path. Most I think don’t even notice us until we go past.
Is motorcycle theft a problem? Yes it is a problem. It is not uncommon for someone to turn up and lift your bike into a van. I use an approved disc lock on my bike whenever I leave it anywhere and many lock their motorcycles to special posts to stop them being lifted.
Do you have access to high quality motorcycling gear in your part of the world? Yes, good quality gear is not a problem to find. The problem I find is that there isn’t the choice for ladies and one day I will find lady size gloves.
Last week in Tokyo, Petra Kvitova had a highly anticipated semifinal with Venus Williams at the 2013 Toray Pan Pacific Open. That match lived up to the hype with three solid sets of tennis by both players. In the end, Petra would get by Venus 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7) en route to taking the title. Kvitova had another battle on her hands in the third round of the 2013 China Open facing the fifth seed, Sara Errani. Despite a bit of a lull in her play midway through, Petra was solid when she needed to be, winning 6-4 6-7 (3) 6-3. The 2011 Wimbledon Champion will barely get a chance to breathe as she faces another stiff challenge against 2011 Roland Garros champion Li Na. Li Na also had a dangerous opponent in round 3, but she was able to fight past Sabine Lisicki in a close straight setter, 7-5 6-4. Undoubtedly, Li Na will have the home crowd on her side regardless of who she plays at this event, but any match with Kvitova is a potential pitfall. If both players bring their A games, it could be a very thrilling match. However, both players are known to be streaky so it could also be a dud of a match. Let’s hope for the former and not the latter.

New Navigator Appointed For Wild Oats XI
The bid by Australian supermaxi yacht Wild Oats XI to establish a race record time for the 2225 nautical mile Transpac race from Los Angeles to Hawaii is back on course after a new navigator was signed on today.
New Zealander Nick White, who has vast experience in around-the-world and international competition, took up the opportunity to replace Stan Honey as the yacht's navigator after Honey withdrew due to injuries he suffered in the Trans-Atlantic race, which finished earlier this week.
Honey, arguably the world's best ocean racing navigator, was injured when he had a fall aboard Kristy and Jim Clark's 100-footer, Comanche, when the yacht was on her way to establishing a remarkable new world sailing record of 620 nautical miles in 24 hours.
A doctor who checked on Honey's condition after Comanche finished the race advised him to rest for the next two weeks. This meant he could not be aboard Wild Oats XI when she started in the Transpac race next Saturday.
Wild Oats XI, which is recognised as Australia's most successful ocean racing yacht, is out to break the race's monohull record of 5 days, 14 hours, 36 minutes, 20 seconds, a mark set by Neville Crichton's Alfa Romeo II in 2009. Her average speed then was 16.6 knots.
With that in mind, the combined Australian and American crew aboard Wild Oats XI returned to the dock after the training run today exceedingly encouraged by what they had experienced. Wild Oats XI had averaged near 22 knots in 17 knots of wind with only her smallest headsail set.
* From Comanche Sailing Team Comanche Sailing has been made aware of an exaggerated release made by an un-associated third party concerning Stan Honey, navigator on Comanche during her recent Transatlantic Race run to England. This strange release was posted without anyone contacting the boat, the crew or any party related to the accident.
To set the facts straight and ease the minds of Stan's many fans and friends in the sailing world, Stan did slip and take a fall inside Comanche on day 5 of the 7 day race, literally within minutes of the end of Comanche's record 24 hour run. He was never unconscious. He did immediately show some signs of concussion and the on board medics contacted the race duty officer and emergency medical facility, and consulted with doctors about the accident. Stan rested for approximately six hours and then resumed his navigational duties for the rest of the race.
Stan was met by his wife Sally and boat owner Jim Clark at the finish and went to the local Falmouth hospital for a CAT scan which proved to show nothing abnormal, but it has been suggested that Stan lay low for a couple weeks to fully recover from the accident. The trip to hospital was purely precautionary and is good practice in cases like these.
Stan and Sally were at the crew party last night in Southampton and are flying back home today as planned and would like to thank all for their support. -- Camilla Green

"TV and Public Host of the 35th America's Cup!" As a sailing TV announcer, when the America's Cup gives you that title you've arrived. That's exactly Tucker Thompson's new role. For the next two years he'll host all public delivery of the event from live TV, to press conferences, public events, video features, and perhaps most importantly he'll host the AC Tour delivering live, multi-media presentations at yacht clubs and other venues around the world.
Thompson, a champion sailor, got into international match racing while still competing in college sailing. After graduating, he raced professionally and was picked up to sail with America True in the 2000 America's Cup trials. From there a career in sailing shifted to one covering the sport. He and then partner, Bruce Nairn, started T2P.TV and after almost 15 years and two more America's Cups as an announcer with longtime friend Andy Green Thompson now sits in the lead role.

The 58.4m luxury world class sailing yacht Kokomo is to undergo a complete inspection in accordance with a five year service plan. Marine Results will carry out the work which includes unstepping the mast and inspecting all components using advanced NDT techniques, and replacing any wearing or faulty components. The team will also remove all the fittings ready for the mast to be painted.
He comments "This is a very tall mast and we believe that it is in fact the tallest ever to be unstepped in Palma. We are bringing in a special crane from mainland Spain to unstep and restep the rig as there is none suitable on the island of Mallorca."
The work will be carried out at STP Boatyard in Palma, Mallorca in September by a team from Marine Results led by Ed Danby.
Kokomo's mast was built by Southern Spars in carbon fibre, and is stayed with Nitronic 50 rod and EC6 carbon stays.

I really need to go out and do more. More of anything. Party, visit friends, go for walks, anything that’ll get me out of the house. Well almost anything than just work, go to the mall, and stay home.
I know I’ll be going out partying either the Friday or Saturday night after my birthday. But 1)I don’t know which night yet; and 2) that’s not until next month.
Basically, I have no life. I’m usually at home most of the time. That’s kind of why I said that I need to go out and do more. My goal for the rest of April, and all of May through October, actually spend at least 1,200 hours (total, over the next few months) out of my house, not at work, and not at the mall. So this should end up being very interesting.

2018 Annual Meeting of the American Studies Association – “States of Emergence”
Panel: Identity Politics
In 2016, political theorist Mark Lilla published “The End of Identity Liberalism” in The New York Times. He quickly declared the emergence of identity politics to be responsible for the election of Donald Trump. His article was widely regarded with contempt from organizing communities that considered it dismissive of groups targeted by the state. However, his writing was also emblematic of the liberal response to emergence: during a state of emergency, the only concern is that of stabilizing the nation. By this very epistemological thread, identity serves many important purposes in conceptualizing American heterogeneity.
In frames like that of Lilla, identity obstructs the larger political telos of Democracy. For others, such Kimberle Crenshaw (who helped popularize the term Identity Politics in her 1991 article “Mapping the Margins”), it is the foundation by which assemblage is possible. This panel questions how identity politics may be in a state of emergence. While identity has always already existed, modernity is often characterized by identities frequently emerging, proliferating, and rapidly collapsing. New Museum curator Johanna Burton describes identity politics as “a paralysis within discourse” through this dialectic. The emergence of white nationalist identities online similarly parallels a greater recognition of how identity politics become co-opted by conservatism. While engaging in the politics of identity, white nationalists deny they care about identity politics. How may these two phrases differ in meaning to different groups? How may paralysis act as a way of understanding the naturalized identity politics of white nationalism?
Within queer theory, identity has likewise long been critiqued from every angle and boundary. To José Esteban Muñoz, the introduction of identity politics into the Humanities was a way in which identity could be used to silence critique and universalize whiteness. Correspondingly, queer studies scholars such as Gayle Salamon consider the destruction of identity politics altogether to be the objective of poststructuralist theory. To others, such as Dean Spade, Heather Love, and Roderick Ferguson, the potentiality of identity has been co-opted for the purposes of “totality”: universalizing whiteness, neoliberalism, and assimilationist politics.
In thinking of identity politics we must additionally understand the multifarious ways of defining, conceptualizing, and determining identity. Identity has historically been theorized in countless forms: consciousness, diversity, being, heterogeneity, difference, or power. How might the emergence of a more tangible rhetoric of identity affect social, political, or epistemological movements? How can identity occlude experience, existence, or emergence itself when used broadly? How can it benefit communities through assemblage?
This panel will present contrasting and sometimes conflicting papers in order to establish a range of thought on the polemical topic. We are specifically looking for original research on how the emergent rhetoric surrounding identity politics has been mobilized in the contemporary period. While we are open to a broad range of interdisciplinary submissions, we are particularly interested in papers that address the following topics:
• Fascism and the (re)emergence of white identity politics
• Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Area Studies’ relationship to identity
• Post-identity identity-based scholarship
• Assemblage theory
• Minoritization
• Defining identity politics
• Abolition
• Queer/transgender theory and identity
• Phenomenological perspectives on identity
• Appropriation, reparation, and affirmation
• Conceptualizations of difference, consciousness, and being
• Cultural implications of the emergence and proliferation of identities
• Digital identities
• Cyborg feminism
• Intergenerational politics
• Identity politics in the 2016 elections
• Identity within art
• Campus politics
• The history of identity politics
• States of exception
• Identity and performative theory
If you would like to present on this panel, please send a 250-350-word abstract along with a short CV to Eli Erlick at eerlick@ucsc.edu by January 21st, 2018.
We are additionally seeking a panel chair. If you are interested in chairing and not presenting, you may also send your CV to the aforementioned email address.

THE LATE BUSH FIRE, Taranaki Herald, Volume XV, Issue 763, 16 March 1867
THE LATE BUSH FIRE
We deeply regret to have to chronicle today a disaster which has overtaken several of our settlers, and those of the most enterprising and energetic amongst ns. Oar readers will, of course, be aware that we alludo to the bush fires which have during the week laid waste a large quantity of our crops, destroyed several homesteads, and deprived us of much of the results of the yearns labour. It is not easy as yet to gain any authentic information of what damage has really been done, or of the extent of the fire, but, as far as we can learn, the following account is correct. It is well known that for several years past, in consequence of the wai', and from other causes, many of those who own lands in the country have been living in tbe town, and have not duly burned off every season the old logs remaining on their country lands. The consequence is that there areVor were, over a largo extent of country six years arrears of logs, all of which must have been burned at some time, and which might any day have taken fire and caused the calamity which ha 3 now befallen us. On Monday last there sprang up a stiff S.E. wind, which continued until Thursday, blowing a regular gaje on Tuesday and Wednesday.
It appears that thero were several bush fires burning at the former date, some lately ignited, some supposed to be extinguished. These the wind took, and fanned until they grew to a terrific sizo. Not only did the dry logs take fire, but tho standing bush was all ablaze, and thus tho flames were carried from clearing to clearing until, as we are told npon g-ood authority, the fire extended from a point inlaud of the Bell Block to the centre of the Omata district.
Dwelling-houses belonging to the following soitlers have, we understand, been destroyed : — Messrs. Hawke, Oliver, Batten, Waite, Burton (two houses), Hartley, and Wheeler. In addition to this, Messrs. Hawke, C. Brown, and Long have lost ricks of hay ; Mr. H. Brown has had his fences, hay, bridges, and a largo quantity of timber prepared for sawing, destroyed. Wo further learn that Mr. Free has lost a horse, which was burned to death. There is little for us to say upon the subject beyond the above bare statement of facts. Taranaki people are by this time too well used to disappointment and misfortune to need any exhortation to perseverance. Each settler knows well that he has the sympathy of his fellow-settlers, whether they express it or not ; each haa made up his mind to look fortune Bteadily in the face, to hope on, and hope ever ; and wo feel confident that each of those who have suffered, or been well nigh ruined in the late fire, will only " set his teeth, and at it again " manfully, with the same vigour as if all his past labours had prospered and been crowned with success.
POST OFFICE SAVINGS' BANKS. We have been requested by the Chief Postmaster to draw the attention of the public to the approaching initiation of the above very useful institution in this Province. The experiment has been already tried, we understand, in the Chief Post Offices at Aucklaud, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin, and has, we believe, worked so satisfactorily that it is intended, as soon as possible, to extend it to all money order offices throughout the colony. The date of commencement has not been absolutely fixed, as it must depend upon the ability of the printing establishment at Wellington to supply the necessary pass books and forms ; but it is hoped that -operations may be generally commenced by the first of the ensuing month. We publish in another column, for the information of our readers, an article from the Canterbury Press upon this subject.

Although Ford celebrated the a hundredth anniversary of its Model T in 2008, there was no cause for GM to rejoice. The auto-making giant posted an annual loss of $39 billion for 2007, the biggest loss ever for any automaker. This colossal failure reflected the slump in the U.S. financial system, and the ceding of market share to international brands, primarily the Japanese Toyota.

Mediation
Mediation is a form of dispute resolution which involves an independent mediator meeting with both people, either together or separately, to try and resolve an issue which has been unable to be resolved by the people themselves.
The process is intended to provide a forum for discussions to take place in a neutral environment with a view to those issues being aired and hopefully overcome. Clients will have the opportunity to talk about their views and feelings and what they would wish to achieve. The process will involve negotiation taking place between the clients to try and reach an agreed resolution.
The ethos of mediation is to empower families to make their own decisions, rather than being told what to do by somebody else, or by entering into court proceedings. Mediation can break through communication difficulties and can help people to resolve issues more easily in the future.

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BEING SCAMMED, AGAIN, BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
ROCKY MONTANA
Rocky Montana
July 18, 2917
For the past eight years, the U.S. Legislative, Administrative, and Judiciary have been using the "Helgian" triadic structure to force socialist medicine and health care on the American people. In short, the Helgian" triadic structure is a sneaky, political trick to foist socialist programs on the masses: THESIS, ANTITHESIS, and SYNTHESIS. Thesis: is a proposition stated or put forward for consideration, especially one to be discussed and proved or to be maintained against objections. Antithesis: Opposite or objection to the thesis. Synthesis: THE BIG SCAM. A compromise between thesis and antithesis.
1. THESIS: In 2009 Barrack Obama and Democrat party, assisted by the Supreme Court, rammed Obamacare (resurrected Kennedycare and Hillarycare) down our collective throats. We-the-people responded by throwing the Democrat majority out of office in a series of three election cycles.2. ANTITHESIS: Shortly after the American people began voicing their objection to Obamacare. In 2010 Republican hopefuls began campaigning against Obamacare and vowed to REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. We-the-people responded by voting these Republicans into office at the U.S. Legislature and Administration levels.3: SYNTHESIS: 2017: After giving the Republicans the White House and the majority in both Houses of Congress, all but a few conservative Republicans in the House and Senate reneged on their campaign promises to REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE. They, instead, have acquiesced to tweak Obamacare (called Obamacare-light) and have even made this monstrosity worse by adding a crony-capitalism provision to set $200 million aside to bail-out the Insurance companies (another government subsidy).(The U.S. government either has not learned its lesson or are efforting to steal, again, from the American people. If a company is too big to fail, it should be broken up into smaller pieces--period! No more "too big to fail" companies; no more bailouts. STOP BIG GOVERNMENT'S "TOO BIG TO FAIL" SCAM!)
So, here we all are, again, at the crossroads of fascist socialism (communism) and free enterprise, free-market capitalism. WHICH WAY DO YOU WANT YOUR NATION TO GO, AMERICANS, AND HOW HARD ARE YOU WILLING TO FIGHT FOR IT?!? I stand with Sen. Paul on this one; we must bring our Republican lawmakers to account, compelling them to either live up to their campaign promises--first REPEAL and then REPLACE OBAMACARE or leave office! And if they don't do either, it is up to us to throw both the deceiving obstructionist Democrats AND deceitful Republicans out of office and start over with new lawmakers who promise to REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE and will live up to their promises.Group Insurance plans worked well in the past for all who work; so why get rid of them? Care Cooperatives may be the future for assuring affordable health care to all Americans who can't get group health insurance. Check out the new medical care paradigm of Josh Empehr, M.D. for instance:"After completing training and becoming a board certified Family Physician, I opened Atlas MD, a practice that I had been dreaming about for nearly a decade. Atlas MD represents my ideal medical practice where I’m able to shrug off the burdens and restrictions of government and insurance regulation so I can focus solely on my patients and their needs."Final note: If U.S. Health Care is, indeed, too expensive for the American people, it is primarily because the U.S. Medical industry is a monopoly, NOT based on free enterprise, free-market capitalism, as all commerce was intended to be by our Founding Fathers. Perhaps it, too, must be broken up into smaller pieces so that it does become competitive and affordable. The Medical, Insurance and Pharmaceutical industries are all, basically monopolies that support one-another, all made possible by our beloved federal government. They are all part of the health care problem. The Medical, Insurance and Pharmaceutical industries are simply making too much money off the backs of the American people. Their profits must come down if the U.S. is ever to have a viable health care system that works for ALL the people. And the only way this will occur, in my opinion, is through competition. The competition: Alternative or Naturopathic Health Care and Healthcare cooperatives. Your AMA doctors and nurses know nothing about alternative healthcare, so don't bother asking them about it. Orthodox Medicine (Medical, Insurance, and Pharmaceutical industry) only know how to manage disease, not cure it. Alternative or Naturopathic Health Care is growing up in the shadows of Orthodox Medicine, despite the best efforts of the AMA and the U.S. government to kill, cull, injure, and/or not allow it to grow. Ones who want to learn about alternative/naturopathic health care and health care cooperatives must do their own research; each must seize responsibility for their own physical and mental health.

TR Center announces Theodore Roosevelt Trail initiative
Theodore Roosevelt’s time as a rancher, hunter and cowboy in the Dakota badlands had a profound and lasting effect on his life, and his legacy continues to shape the North Dakota experience. A new initiative by the Theodore Roosevelt Center highlights a dozen or so specific sites across the state, illuminating Roosevelt’s impact on North Dakota.
The Theodore Roosevelt Trail consists of well-known places such as Theodore Roosevelt’s Elkhorn Ranch in the badlands of southwestern North Dakota, the Theodore Roosevelt National Park that houses his original Maltese Cross Ranch cabin, and Sullys Hill National Game Preserve which Roosevelt established in 1904 as a national park. While these sites offer beauty and an atmosphere for reflection, the “Trail” also includes lesser-known, but still significant, locations that reveal the legacy of TR in North Dakota.
“We know that Roosevelt had a much wider influence in North Dakota than just his legacy in the badlands,” said Clay Jenkinson, humanities scholar for the Theodore Roosevelt Center. “In working on this project, and using materials from the TR Center archives, we discovered that every one of these sites has a fascinating, and as yet untold, story.”
To encourage travel on the TR Trail, the Center has produced a brochure and webpage that give a brief overview of these Roosevelt-related places, including a map and directions to each site. The brochure is available in rest areas throughout North Dakota. The webpage includes more detailed information about each site.
“Our goal is not only to encourage people to visit these sites, but then to use our TR Center resources to learn more about TR’s footprint across North Dakota,” Jenkinson said.
The TR Center sees this initiative not only as a way to highlight the Roosevelt-related sites in North Dakota, but also as an opportunity for the project to expand into other states.
“We want to encourage every other state, especially in the West, to use our template and create the TR Trail of Montana, Oregon, and so on,” said Jenkinson.
Points of interest along the “Trail”
Dakota National Forest
The Dakota National Forest was established by Roosevelt in 1908. The 13,940-acre Ponderosa Pine forest is situated along the Little Missouri River in the southern badlands of western North Dakota. Although its National Forest status was abolished in 1917, visitors can still access the forest by visiting the Logging Camp Ranch, a working cattle ranch that offers camping and cabins.
Roosevelt Statue-Dickinson
Dickinson is home to a life-sized bronze sculpture of Roosevelt that graces the Stark County Courthouse grounds. The statue, sculpted by Tom Bollinger, stands on the site of Roosevelt’s first great national speech in 1886. Interpretive panels describe TR’s time in the badlands and the opportunity to speak that brought him to the Independence Day celebration in Dickinson.
Theodore Roosevelt National Park
Theodore Roosevelt National Park is located in the heart of the North Dakota badlands and consists of more than 70,000 acres. The rugged beauty and harshness of the land was well-noted by Roosevelt who stated, “It was here that the romance of my life began.”
Elkhorn Ranch
The Elkhorn Ranch is one of two ranches Roosevelt established in the badlands. Here he grieved for his wife and mother who died within hours of each other on Valentine’s Day 1884. It was also here that he became enamored with the strenuous life and conservation. Although the buildings are gone, the foundation stones of Roosevelt’s cabin remain.
Lower Yellowstone Irrigation District
The Lower Yellowstone Irrigation District is located on the North Dakota-Montana border and is one of 24 such projects authorized by the Roosevelt administration as a result of the Newlands Reclamation Act passed in 1902.
Roosevelt Statue-Minot
A large bronze statue of Roosevelt on horseback stands at Roosevelt Park in Minot. The statue was commissioned by Roosevelt’s longtime friend Dr. Henry Waldo Coe and created by artist Alexander Phimister Proctor. It was cast in 1923 and donated to the City of Minot in 1924. Coe had three such statues made: one, a larger scale model of the same design, is in Portland, Ore.; a second, which was cast a year earlier, is in Mandan, N.D.
Sullys Hill
Roosevelt designated Sullys Hill a National Park in 1904, and it was redefined as a National Game Preserve in 1914. The preserve is located on the south shore of Devils Lake in Benson County. Wildlife that had been decimated during western settlement, such as bison, elk, and white-tailed deer, were re-introduced to the park in 1917-18. Sullys Hill is home to abundant wildlife that can be observed while driving the four-mile auto tour or while hiking one of two nature trails. A visitor’s center offers information about the types of birds and animals on site, as well as educational events.
Stump Lake National Wildlife Refuge
Roosevelt established Stump Lake National Wildlife Refuge in 1905. The refuge consisted of four islands and was intended as a bird sanctuary. With the natural expansion of nearby Devils Lake, the islands are now underwater. There is, however, a recreation area on the east side of Stump Lake.
Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge
Roosevelt gave the executive order to establish Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge in 1908, when the native nesting pelican population had dropped to only 50 birds because of indiscriminate hunting. Three years earlier, local settler H.H. McCumber had counted about 500 pelicans nesting at the lake. Today, the Refuge is home to more than 30,000 breeding pelicans during the summer months. In the fall, they migrate south and are believed to spend the winters on the Gulf Coast. The shallow, alkaline lake covers more than 3,000 acres and is surrounded by medium-grass prairie. The best time to view the pelicans is mid-April to late August.
Roosevelt Statue, Old Main, NDSU campus, Fargo
In May 1910, Theodore Roosevelt was asked by United States Representative Louis Hanna (later governor of North Dakota) to sit for a sculpture by Gustav Vigeland of Christiania (Oslo), Norway. Vigeland planned to create a large statue of Roosevelt, but Roosevelt felt that a sculpture of a pioneer or cowboy would be more representative of North Dakota. He also wrote it was his firm belief that “…no man should ever have a statue until he has been dead some little time.” Consequently, the large version of the statue was never cast. However, in the 1970s, the American Scandinavian Foundation helped procure a cast of the plaster model and it now resides in Old Main on the North Dakota State University campus in Fargo.
Roosevelt 1910 library dedication cornerstone, Bonanzaville, Fargo
On May 9, 1910, Theodore Roosevelt spoke at the cornerstone-laying ceremony for the Fargo College Library, which was located on 7th Street South in Fargo. The Fargo College closed in 1922 and the building was razed in 1964. The cornerstone, however, was preserved and is currently housed at Bonanzaville USA in West Fargo.
Theodore Roosevelt International Highway
The North Dakota section of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway (U.S. Highway 2) runs along the northern tier of the state from Grand Forks to the Montana border. The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway was a transcontinental North American highway through the United States and Canada from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon with a total length of about 4,060 miles. The highway was designated a memorial after Roosevelt’s death in 1919. In 1926, the federal government adopted the United States Numbered Highway System, and by the 1930s the name “Theodore Roosevelt International Highway” fell into disuse.
Roosevelt Statue, Five Nations Arts, Main Street, Mandan
The equestrian statue was commissioned by Theodore Roosevelt’s long-time friend Dr. Henry Waldo Coe. Sculptor Alexander Phimister Proctor designed the sculpture to reflect the qualities of courage, fearlessness and controlled energy that Coe had always admired in Roosevelt.
The statue was cast in 1922 and dedicated July 2, 1924. It was placed along Main Street at the eastside depot park. In 1930, it was relocated to accommodate the construction of the current depot at 401 W. Main St., which now houses Five Nations Arts, and sits on the intersection of Main Street and Third Avenue. Coe had three such statues made: one, a larger scale model of the same design, is in Portland, Ore.; a second, which was cast a year later, is in Minot, N.D.
North Dakota State Capitol Rough Rider Award Recipients Display
The Roughrider Award is the highest honor bestowed by the state of North Dakota and is an honorary rank of Colonel in the North Dakota Theodore Roosevelt Rough Riders. The award was established during the 1961 Dakota Territory Centennial and recognizes present or former North Dakotans who have been influenced by North Dakota and achieved national recognition. Recipients of the award are chosen by the Governor, in agreement with the Secretary of State, and the Director of the State Historical Society. The recipients’ achievements reflect honor on North Dakota and its people. To date, 39 North Dakotans have received the award. Their portraits can be seen in the lower level of the North Dakota State Capitol Building.
Theodore Roosevelt Expressway
The Theodore Roosevelt Expressway (TRE, also known as U.S. Highway 85 and U.S. Highway 2) traverses the western side of the state, beginning at the South Dakota border on U.S. Highway 85 to Williston, where it turns west on U.S. Highway 2 to the Montana border. The entire route begins at Rapid City, S.D., and ends where it enters Canada at the Port of Raymond in Montana. The TRE is the northern third of the Ports to Plains Alliance, a proposed four-lane highway promoting trade and transportation through the Great Plains. The southern section of the expressway takes travelers through rural agricultural country that skirts the badlands Theodore Roosevelt loved. The central section crosses oil country, and to the north is rural prairie land. Traveling the TR Expressway offers a look at the diversity of both nature and industry in western North Dakota.GreenPois0n RC6 for Apple TV 2G would also bring Untethered Jailbreak.

The company also introduced a brand new addition to the lineup which will surely set the performance and feature bar for future Ultrabooks. Apple annoyingly is calling this the ‘Macbook Pro with retina display’, despite that it is smaller, lighter, and uses a totally different chassis than the Macbook Pro (it’s almost as thin as the MacBook Air, actually). The screen is 15.4″ and a whopping 2880×1800 resolution, but the unit is still fairly light at 2.02kg and thin at 18mm. Step inside to learn everything there is to know about Apple’s new MacBook Pro with retina display.
Don’t let the thinness and light weight fool you, there’s a lot of premium features in this beast. In fact, the Macbook Pro with retina display is even more powerful and feature rich than the thicker MacBook Pro lineup.
Retina Display, 2880×1800
The big news of course is the 15.4″ 2880×1800 display which is the highest resolution seen in an laptop computer and has 2.5x more pixels than the 1080p display found on Asus’ Zenbook Prime. Apple says that they’ve enhanced the contrast ratio, viewing angle, and have reduced the glare from the screen by 75% while maintaining the deep blacks that come from using a glossy display. Note that 2880×1800 is actually a 16:10 aspect ratio; in recent years most companies have been moving to 16:9, the same shape found on an HDTV, this is a step counter to that trend.
Processors
Based on Ivy Bridge, this is actually not using the same Ivy Bridge platform as specified by Intel’s Ultrabook criteria. To be an Ultrabook, a device must use the ULV (ultra low voltage) version of Intel’s processors (designated by a ‘U’ at the end of the CPU name. Instead, Apple has equipped the MacBook Pro with retina display with the mid-range option (designated with an ‘M’) which is hotter and more power hungry, but it also opens the door to quad-core options (designated with a ‘Q’) which is what this unit is equipped with.
Apple is offering two versions of the MacBook Pro with retina display. The low end configuration uses a ‘2.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz) with 6MB shared L3 cache’ according to Apple, which we’re willing to bet maps to the i7-3615QM (technical details here).
Apple specifies the high end version of the Macbook Pro with retina display as having one of two options:
- 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz) with 6MB shared L3 cache
- 2.7GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 (Turbo Boost up to 3.7GHz)
This means that we’re likely looking at the i7-3720QM (2.6GHz) and i7-3820QM (2.7GHz) (technical details and comparison here).
Specifications
Default RAM is 8GB 1600MHz, but you can configure up to 16GB. The low-end version of the MacBook Pro with retina display comes equipped with a 256GB SSD which cannot be configured. The higher-end version gives you the choice between a 512GB and 768GB SSD. Both versions are equipped with integrated HD 4000 graphics and an NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M with 1GB of GDDR5 memory which is Nvidia’s middle GPU offering in terms of performance and uses the latest ‘Kepler’ architecture. Switching between the discrete and integrated graphics is automatic.With a huge screen to drive, a power hungry non-ULV platform, and a discrete GPU, you’d think that the MacBook Pro with retina display would get terrible battery life; Apple has gone to great lengths to prevent this — the inside of the unit is packed full of a 95 watt-hour battery — and has managed to deliver 7 hours of web use. Expect lengthy charge times.
Apple did something interesting with the fans. To reduce noise they placed the fan blades asymmetrically which they claim spreads the noise over a range of frequencies, instead of stacking them at a single frequency, making the fans sound quieter an less obtrusive.
For the first time ever, Apple is including a full HDMI port on this unit (finally), along with a solid array of ports: 2xUSB 3.0, 2x Thunderbolt, full SDXC slot, and the MagSafe adapter (which has been redesigned to be thinner).
The OS has been updated to support the retina display. A few key apps will already be ready to support the new display such as Adobe Photoshop, Aperture, Final Cut Pro 10, AutoCAD, and even Blizzard’s Diablo 3.
The MacBook Pro with retina display is equipped with dual microphones which ought to work well with the dictation function which is coming with OSX Mountain Lion due to be release later this summer. Apple also says that the stereo speakers in this unit are the best they’ve ever equipped a laptop with. The keyboard is backlit as well.
Apple also interestingly touted a new function called Power Nap which allows the Macbook Pro with retina display to update itself from standby. For anyone following Ultrabook’s, you’ll notice that this sounds suspiciously familiar to Intel’s Smart Connect functionality. It’s likely that Ivy Bridge is what’s allowing Apple to accomplish this (just like an Ultrabook proper), and it doesn’t appear as though we’ll see Power Nap until OSX Mountain Lion.
Apple’s calling the Macbook Pro with retina display “the very best computer we’ve ever built”, and I think they can say that with a straight face.
Price and Release DateOf course, all of this is going to cost you a pretty penny. The ‘low-end’ version (if you can call it that!) of the Macbook Pro with retina display starts at $2199 and can be configured up to $2399 by doubling the RAM from 8GB to 16GB. The top-end Macbook Pro with retina display starts at $2799 and can go as high as $3749 if by bumping up the CPU from 2.6GHz to 2.7GHz, the RAM from 8GB to 16GB, and the SSD from 512GB to 768GB.
The Macbook Pro with retina display’s release date is today! You can go online and order one now. The low-end model is currently listed as shipping in 5-7 days; same for the high-end model, unless you equip it with the 768GB SSD option, then you’ll find yourself waiting 3-5 weeks.

AARP is proud to represent and serve 162,888 Delaware: 76 percent of Delawareans age 50+ voted in the 2008 election, sending a clear message that it’s time for elected officials from both sides of the aisle to come together to solve our nation’s problems.
AARP: Working To Improve the Lives of All Delawareans
Strengthening Social Security: We are fighting to strengthen Social Security for current and future generations by:
- Providing relief for 149,239 who won’t receive a cost of living increase (COLA) this year.
Protecting Medicare: We are fighting to protect guaranteed benefits for the 139,709 Delawareans who receive their health care through Medicare.
Improving Health Care: We are fighting to stop insurance abuses and protect the Medicare benefits seniors have earned by:
- Lowering drug costs for 45,998 seniors by closing the Medicare Part D coverage gap or “doughnut hole.”
- Preventing insurance companies from denying affordable coverage to up to 15,000 Delawareans age 50-64 based on age or pre-existing condition.
- Expanding access to home and community-based services through Medicaid – the largest payer of long-term services and supports – which, in 2007, spent only 10 percent of long-term care dollars in on home and community based-services for older adults and adults with physical disabilities and 90 percent on institutional care for the same population.
Supporting Caregivers: AARP is fighting to ensure more Americans can receive the services they need to live independently in their homes and communities by:
- Valuing and supporting the 158,000 family caregivers in Delaware – individuals who provide help to their loved ones to enable them to live at home and whose unpaid contributions are valued at $1,280,000,000.
- Promoting Retirement Savings: We are fighting to help Americans save for retirement by:
- Enacting Automatic IRA legislation, which would help many of the estimated 206,000 Delawareans who don’t currently have a retirement plan at work to have simple access to a retirement savings account.
AARP: Fighting for Delaware
The. Since Medicaid is a significant portion of state budgets, it is, unfortunately, a likely target for cuts. Protecting services to these populations is a high priority for AARP members in every state, especially since Medicaid is the backbone of our long-term care system and those relying on home and community-based services.
AARP Delaware is educating its members about state budget issues, conducting research on member opinions about policy options, and working with other stakeholders in coalitions to help lawmakers prioritize their decisions.
AARP continues to fight for its members and preserve critical services.

Some days I can change the world, and on others I can’t get out of bed.
I love deeply, and fall hard.
I think thoroughly and deeply and once I have, I strive for balance, justice and equality.
I’m fun and outgoing, yet at times I’m reserved and shy.
When I find that something isn’t going as planned, I sometimes feel let down and discouraged.
Sometimes I’d rather give up, than settle.
The people who I look up to the most are the ones that get things done. They know what they want and don’t stop till they get what they want.
Sometimes I don’t know why I can’t be that person. I try.
Am I too hard on myself?
Do I give up too easily?
Do I worry too much?
Do I do enough? try enough? work enough?
At the end of the day, there may be more questions than answers, but I’m glad that I’m here and I try.This time I decided to use ½ litre of beans instead of a full litre because of the juggling of pots and containers required by a full litre. It was much easier and faster. We removed as many of the skins as possible to help remove the beany taste and then we boiled them and drained the water 4 times hoping to further reduce the beany taste. Then we puréed them in the blender again. With the blender less full, the puré was much finer. A litre of water was used. Although the mixture was not as thick as last time, I decided to add a ¼ of water to give a bit more soymilk. As with the last attempt, I boiled the mixture at a high temperature setting for 10 minutes stirring constantly. When it came to a boil, I turned the temperature down to simmer and cooked for another 10 minutes stirring constantly.
Straining the mixture was also a great deal easier and faster because of the reduced quantity. As with the last attempt, I decided to do another batch from the puré. I put the puré back in the pot, added a ¼ litre of water, brought it to a boil and put it through the strainer again.
There was a very fine residue that passed through the strainer on the last attempt which tasted like a soft grit. So we decided to filter the soymilk one last time. We decided to use a jelly bag rather than a cheese cloth because it could be reused and cleaned up easily.
The taste was still beany. In fact, it was impossible to tell the difference in taste between this attempt and the last.
After chilling the soymilk, per the above linked article on making stove-top soymilk, I added maple syrup to taste and ¼ tsp of salt.
WE HAVE EDIBLE SOYMILK!
(barely and only if you use it in coffee)
In my research, I’ve come across comments that the quality of the soymilk and its taste are affected by the type of soybeans that you use and their freshness. There are specialty or novel soybeans which are used to produce various soyfoods of Asian origin, such as tofu, miso, soy sauce, natto, soymilk, and tempeh. Other than Laura soybeans, I’ve seen no specific type of soymilk-associated bean available commercially. I will continue to search.
Secondly, and more importantly, I came across information that said to skip the soaking stage and place uncooked beans into boiling water:
In 1969 Mattick and Hand at Cornell.
and
The beany flavor comes from a reaction involving the enzyme lipoxgenase (not trypsin inhibitor) enzyme, fat, water and oxygen. The method you are using, soaking in water and grinding will produce good quality soymilk but it will have the beany taste. To avoid the beany taste try the following. Take whole, unsoaked soybean and drop them into vigorously boiling water at least a 5:1 water to bean ratio. Cook for 30 minutes prior to grinding. Dehulling will remove the fiber and result in a soymilk with a smoother mouth feel but it will not reduce the beany flavor. Baking soda will improve the mouth feel and flavor of your soymilk but will not affect the beany flavor. Phytic acid is not destroyed by heat, at least not the heat you are using. It does not affect the beany taste. in a hot water solution of sodium bicarbonate converts the soybeans into a colloid solution (soyslurry) without unwanted enzyme activity.
and from the National Soybean Research Laboratory
Method
1..
2. Grind the beans: Grind the blanched beans with 8 cups (2 liters) of hot water for 3 minutes using a blender on high speed. (If the blender is not large enough, do this in two batches.) Work carefully and be sure the lid is on tight as this is hot.
3. Strain the mixture: Cool the mixture until it is just warm to the touch and filter it by squeezing it through a cheesecloth. Reserve the solids (okara) for another use.
4. Simmer: Simmer the filtered liquid on the stove for 20 minutes. Stir occasionally. If desired, add sugar, salt, and/or other flavorings to taste.
So we will make one last batch of soymilk using a portion of the Laura soybeans that I have and reserve the rest for seed. And we will skip the soaking stage and put the beans directly into boiling water.
If you use a Blendtech Blender you dont have to strain it. These blenders are $400 but they turn any food or rock or wood into a consistency like mayo as an option. Completely smooth for any food type. My milk taste great. ThanksThis time last week the only Ted Williams anyone had ever heard of was the baseball player. Then a reporter for the Columbus Dispatch, Doral Chenoweth III, posted a short clip on the internet on a slow news day and overnight Ted Williams went from homeless to a star with job offers reportedly coming from the Cleveland Cavaliers, Oprah Winfrey, Jack Nicholson, Kraft Foods, and many more.
I don’t believe in blind coincidence. If things come together coincidentally, then I feel this is God’s signpost pointing us down the right path. And, there are so many things about this story that are coincidental. What drew the reporter and the homeless man together on that particular corner? Chenoweth claims he actually shot the clip a couple of weeks prior to posting it. Why did he hold onto the clip? If it had been posted before Christmas, it would, most likely, have been lost in the holiday shuffle. A slow news day at the start of a new year was a perfect time to place some “filler” on the newspaper’s web site. A feel-good human interest story will always attract some interest.
So, let’s say the stars were aligned perfectly to look favorably down upon Ted Williams. However, Ted Williams, himself, played a large part in this scenario by being prepared at the right moment. He was not afraid to do a little self-promoting on his sign. He proudly proclaimed on his sign that he had a God-given voice. There is that word again—God.
In spite of all the suffering Ted Williams had gone through he still recognized that he had a special gift from God. When Chenoweth gave him the money and asked to hear his “God given voice” Williams not only launched into an impromptu audition but also thanked him for the opportunity and asked God to bless him. What kind of ex con and drug addict says something like that? One who was raised in a prayerful home. I have included links to several clips from the Columbus Dispatch video site. Be sure to watch the one of the reunion of Ted Williams with his mother. They both speak of their prayers over the years.
I have developed a unique belief—one I have never read or heard of from any other source. I believe God has given each one of us a special talent. It is up to us to find and develop that talent and use it for good purposes. Sometimes it is difficult finding our talent but each person knows deep within himself what that talent is. Usually teachers, parents, or other counselors help us discover it during our youth. It is then up to us to nurture and grow our talent to the best of our abilities. And, it is never too late to develop that talent. Remember Grandma Moses who didn’t take up painting until she was in her seventies?
I feel this talent is not only God-given but serves as our tie to our creator. Many times when I am writing I am deep in thought and concentration (or is it meditation) and when a piece is finished and I read it I often wonder where some of the words and phrasing came from.
The opposite side of this belief is that if we abuse or neglect our talent then we will suffer in some way. It is sometimes, but not always, physical suffering such as Ted Williams has gone through but it may be in the form of a spiritual dryness.
Putting all religious theories aside, it is wonderful Ted Williams got his second chance. He was prepared to take advantage of an opportunity when he saw it. However, now the hard work begins. Many problems often accompany overnight fame. Has he recovered from his drug and alcohol addictions enough to resist the temptations now before him?
Sadly, I see in today’s news that he has already garnered negative press. It seems he and his daughter got into an argument loud enough to cause others in the hotel to call police. He also admitted that during the press whirlwind he was nervous and asked for a nerve pill. I am asking all of you to join me in sending prayers his way to encircle him with positive energies to enable him to resist temptations and live a rich and rewarding life now that he is on a new path. He is going to need the help of many. I hope he doesn’t blow it.

If on higher end spec bikes; they’ll last longer and require less maintanace.
There are three. Also look out for Freecoaster hubs on higher end bikes - these allow you to fakie (go backwards) without the need to pedal backwards at the same time..
Branded after-market tyres are best here. The sizes (width) of tyre vary and depends on personal preference of the rider. 2.2" wide is about average.
Cranks take a lot of abuse on a bike and need to be strong enough to match your level of riding. Tubular cranks are best whilst branded cranks are better still.
There are 2 types of Bottom Bracket (BB). U.S are the largest and normally come with unsealed bearings. The Smaller Mid BB's are nearly always sealed and as result are stronger,. They either clamp the bars from the top (top loader) or the front (front loader)
The length of the top tube is what all BMX Bikes are measured by. Use this handy chart below to ensure you get the correct size.Baseball Toaster was unplugged on February 4, 2009.

In this week's episode of "Love that Ari":
Fleischer. Ari Fleischer.
After their wedding in Indianapolis, White House press secretary Ari Fleischer and his bride, Rebecca Davis, honeymooned last week on the Caribbean island of Nevis and stayed at the plush Four Seasons Resort.
And just like movie stars and other privacy-conscious celebrities in search of peace and quiet, they registered under assumed names. In this case, Mr. and Mrs. Williams.
"Um, this is correct," a sheepish Fleischer acknowledged yesterday when we reached him in Prague, where President Bush has been attending a NATO conference. "We were just given security advice not to use our real names. Until you blew my cover, I've been traveling under the name of Bernie Williams. Now I will no longer be able to use that name."
Bernie Williams, of course, is a New York Yankees outfielder. Fleischer is a die-hard Yankees fan. And Nevis, if anyone cares, is "Heaven on Earth," Fleischer told us.
So now what fake identity can he assume to avoid potential trouble?
"Derek Jeter is too obvious and Alfonso Soriano is not credible," Fleischer explained, "which is why I went for Bernie Williams."
He scoffed at our suggestion: George Steinbrenner.
"The whole purpose," he said, "is not to become a target."

But the only police shooting which was obviously an actual murder was the killing of Walter Scott by North Charleston police officer Michael Slager.
Now, after a lot of of hate crimes which were not quite as advertised, or even hoaxes, we have an actual hate crime. Again, it took place in Charleston.
The odds of such happening in the same state are .02 x .02, or .004, meaning, four chances in a thousand. The odds of it happening in the same metropolitan area are even lower.
It's probably just coincidence. But it's quite a coincidence.

What is it about Charleston, South Carolina?
3 comments:
It's a shame, because Charleston is a really nice city.
There is also this horrific Charleston crime that garnered approximately zero attention, the shooting death of 5 yo Allison Griffon in her own bed by four AA men who shot their way into the house.
Guess that's pretty run of the mull nowadays.

When the Vuelta de España cycling tour passes through here, this mountain is categorized as a first category climb. It’s big. There’s 20 km from Estepona to the top of Los Reales from the main road, and then another 5 km on a tiny road to the very top, where there’s a small “Refugio” built. I’ve climbed this mountain on a bicycle before … once.
About 2 km before the refugio, there is a footpath known as the Paseo de los Pinsapos. The path goes out and back, through some beautiful forest of Pinsapo trees (evergreens, like pines) and is about 3.5 km long. We walked this with the kids for what seemed like forever, but when we got back to the car, I checked the map, and it looks like we did about 1/10th of the path. Oh well.
We then drove the last 2 km to the top, where we found a small group of British painters who’d come up the mountain for some landscape painting. Rare for the summertime, there was a lot of cloud cover, so the Brits had to be content painting pine cones.
My big disappointment of the day came with the discovery that the kitchen at the refugio was closed. Last time I was here in the wintertime, it was open and was serving some hearty potato soup, iberian ham sandwiches and the like. With limited options, we sat down at one of the massive wooden tables, opened the cooler, and had some homemade sandwiches and fruit.
After lunch, we decided to head down the opposite side of the mountain (inland), and worked our way down to the mountain village of Jubrique. The scenery in this area is absolutely spectacular. Leaving Jubrique, the winding road eventually heads up an unbelievable climb to the small town of Algatocin. (Just outside Jubrique, we passed the Venta San Juan, where we should have eaten. We stopped for a coffee, and man did that barbecue smell good!)
From Algatocin, we continued upward to Gaucin, a bigger (though still in the category of “small”) town, which seem to be oddly populated with foreigners. We stopped at a park in Gaucin, where the kids played, and Daddy smashed his head on the top of a swingset that was just under six feet tall. (Don’t they have standards or something for this kind of thing?)
Leaving Gaucin, we worked our way down and around towards Casares, a “mountain” town one arrives to about 10 minutes from the coastline. We stopped off in Casares for another coffee, and let the kids spend some quality time terrifying some poor cat.
By this point in the afternoon, I was pretty tired, but we decided to stop in Estepona, and let the kids play on the massive playgrounds they’ve constructed along the boardwalk.
Just when I thought we were finally going to head home, my wife got the idea that we should make a final stop at Agro Jardin — sort of a Home Depot of gardening located between Estepona and Marbella. The kids joined in, and quickly let me know I’d have a mutiny on my hands if I didn’t stop.
In addition to plants, terrace furniture and garden tools, Agro Jardin also sell all sorts of living things — dogs, fish, mice, lizards, scorpions and tarantulas. After scaring off an iguana, and then getting terrified by a giant squawking exotic bird, the kids went off to play on the two-level enclosed indoor playground. (The playground is situated next to a bar. Agro Jardin make sure there’s plenty to entertain dad and the kids, so mom has all the time she needs to buy boatloads of plants.) It’s interesting to observe the social rules and patterns that emerge when about 15 kids of various sizes and ages end up together inside an enclosed plaything like that.
Got home around 8:00 pm or thereabouts, eventually put the kids to bed and sat down to decide between GTD planning, or watching some tube. The TV won out.

From Dylan to Kanye: The fundamentally changed “voice of a generation” concept - Part One
Words By: Roland Ellis | April 26th, 1965
It’s a curious thing that in 2015, a man who embodies what is surely the antithesis of 1960s Bob Dylan has come to represent what we might call “the voice of this generation”. The man I’m referring to is Kanye West, and for anyone who has been living under a rock for the past ten years, West is a guy who towers above the modern music industry to an unrivalled extent in terms of influence and profile. And while his credibility has increasingly come under fire in recent times, his track record since the very early 2000s suggests, as The New York Times recently put it, that "his musical legacy is peerless". Well, that’s if you’re measuring it against his contemporaries only…Maybe…While Dylan did everything he could to duck "the voice" moniker, you could bet your house that West would do precisely the opposite.
The point is that West is the closest thing we have to a modern day Dylan—a voice under 30-ers (predominantly) turn to en masse for a lens capable of distilling their feelings and fantasies about the world they live in via melodic verse; a guy who, according to a critical glut, can be relied on to push boundaries and really say something relevant to the world’s principle generation with each release. And while I acknowledge that there are distinct differences between the, let’s say, ‘genre package’, presented by each of these artists, I would dispute the idea that these differences preclude the two men from comparison. After all, I’m not comparing Dylan and West on the basis of their musical similarities necessarily, but on their more or less equivalent musical legacies and the respective means through which they achieved them at a fifty-year remove from one another. As such, I would argue that the comparison stands on the basis of analogous levels and types of both critical and market appreciation. What the Dylan side of the equation gives up in terms of mass-market appeal, West gives back via occasional critical controversy, until what you have in the final wash up is two men more or less equally worthy of their “voice of a generation” titles (time for the mathletes among you to get out your logarithmic graphs and completely explode my theory here…).
But while Dylan did everything he could to duck "the voice" moniker, you could bet your house that West would do precisely the opposite. In fact, he’s spent the last five years pretty much endowing himself with it: In 2014 he compared himself to Roald Dahl’s visionary character, Willy Wonka; and in 2013, West likened himself to Steve Jobs, Picasso, and Walt Disney, and even then we're not all the way to the bottom of Kanye's self-proclaimed-genius rabbit hole. But nevertheless, it's all good, the pundits haven't run for the hills or gone to the mattresses. On the contrary, they've clamoured around the man in the middle for a closer look, as though West were the Pope in that funny little Pope car - to be sure, he certainly wouldn't feel like the comparison is unwarranted. Exactly why fans and critics alike have gathered at the alter of Kanye is, I would suggest, because to be “the voice of a generation” is a fundamentally different concept now compared to what it was in Bob Dylan’s time as the title holder.
In the next instalment I will discuss how the parameters and guidelines for holding the title of "voice of a generation" have changed between Dylan and West’s hay<<(February 18, Thursday)
My second appointment with my SSA turned out to be full of surprises. The first being that the English Literature degree will be changed in March to Bachelor of Arts in English with an emphasis in writing. Also, there are only 13 others who attend the university that are enrolled in English Literature. I have no doubt that the change was to reach out to graduates either interested in writing or teaching because normally those who want to teach take English Literature. However, the university offers various Education degrees for that purpose, and English with an emphasis in writing would fill the gap for those solely interested in writing: me.
The rest of the day consisted of a headache and Karaoke night for the first time. It was fun but also awkward and annoying. After that, I went with some friends to a Mexican restaurant right next to a Taco Bell just to meet up with others and chat. I felt so disconnected because of my headache and introverted low self-esteem amongst many extroverts. Yes, I enjoy the company of extroverts, but I don’t want to come off as a boring individual who only enjoys laughing at the humor of others simply because I’m respectful. My first impression is always horrible, and that is because I could care less if you want to be friends because you think I’m funny; I want to enjoy friendships through the deeper aspects of life that we so often avoid talking about.COFCO Corporation is a leading supplier of agri-products, diversified foodstuffs and services in China, integrating agri-trading, logistics, processing, production and sale links, and providing grain and oil products to one quarter of global population.

Where will Qwiki fall in rankings on Search Engines?
Google resides as the most widely used search engine. Amongst their competition is Yahoo, Bing and perhaps now Qwiki. Qwiki is an Interactive Search Engine, and could quite possibly give Google a run for their money, ultimately changing the way that people utilize the internet and quest to find information.
Before now, the
way that a search engine displayed search results, was to provide the user with
links that would take them to a website to review the searched for information.
Qwiki aims to give an entirely new experience when searching the web. Now,
rather than links and small tad bits of information, Qwiki tells a story, combining
the text that other search engines display with the information on an online
information source such as Wiki.com and then accompany the information with a
visual element comparable to experiencing something on You Tube. Qwiki has been
partly funded by the co-founder of Face book, Eduardo Saverin who has given $8 million
towards its development.
Why search on Google to read information when you can utilize a search engine that will give the same information, but spare you the effort to actually read the findings. With Qwiki an audio/visual summary of information covering the search term is played- taking virtually all effort out of searching for information. When you are through with your search findings Qwiki takes information sharing to the next level, returning text to the user as well as a Multi-Media Presentation. With applications for your Mobile and I-Pad on the way, could Qwiki be taking the spot of Google as the most utilized search engine?
Although the innovation behind Qwiki blows the offerings of Google’s search engine away, does it really stand to give Google a run for their money for their TOP SPOT PLACEMENT AS THE LEADER OF ALL POWER HOUSE SEARCH ENGINES? With the launch of the Search Engine still fresh, it is too soon to tell the effect if any that Qwiki will have to Google. In the grand scheme of things 8million dollars may sound like a lot of money, but is equivalent to excess pocket change to a corporation such as Google. With the billions that Google has accumulated through its numerous endeavors over the years, they are not likely to be taken by surprise by anyone, even if Qwiki does become a household name.
Who knows, there is always the chance that Qwiki will partner up with another billion dollar company, such as Apple or Microsoft- and have the backing to reform Search Engines and put Google’s run as leaders of the Internet to an end. To give an accurate comparison, it is safe to say that this is a David and Goliath type of affair-and with technology, based on power and power based on money, Google won’t be losing their title anytime soon. Only time and search results will tell what the future holds for Qwiki, Google, and how we receive Information from the Internet.

I've tried it a few times. Qwiki is interesting -- especially the computer generated audio. But it can not replace Google. It is fine for a quick summary of a topic. But I am not able to go deep into a topic and dig for obscure facts since I am not able to type in long phrase into the search bar.
qwiki is definitely cool...i am part of their beta group and it is fun checking out the new updates to their site. it is coming along nicely btw. is going to threaten all the other search engines IMHO.
Google cannot currently be threatened monetarily, but if Google is no longer "cool" then anything is possible. All it takes is for a company to strike the public's fancy to take off. Qwiki certainly looks like they are searching for that element of style that will appeal to users, and if they have found it Microsoft or Apple might come calling. Google certainly isn't in trouble, but nothing lasts forever.

Interesting hub H.C., like some of the other readers I hadn't heard of Qwiki. Google seems to be the only company that has an algorithm which consistently and almost magically returns the bext and most relevant results to the user -- I think as long as nobody else can compete in this area, they will not lose market share. Qwiki could definitely squeeze into the market though, it's a cool idea, and people love to look at pictures.
I fully support them as an alternative. Maybe Google knows their method could become outdated so they went into android phones, maps, apps, voicemail, etc. Then again, Google is well-branded and sitting on lots of cash to keep their adwords from faltering. I tried qwiki and see it as a wikipedia alternative w/ audio. I am on the fence for this one.
interesting hub
I had never heard of this search engine.
Good Hub :)
It is a very interesting concept and I hope that it grows. The only problem I foresee is that it isn't very friendly towards those of us with slow internet connections. That is one of Google's biggest advantages.
H.C. - Thank you for helping me learn about this search engine.
Gus :-)))
Good hub, wouldn't it be wonderful if some of us designed a new search engine, and got rich overnight.
Interesting hub. I'd be willing to give Qwili a chance. I know I'm not enamored by Bing.

Hey Holly, a company could survive against Google and the other powerhouses, if they choose to do so, but will need a lot more than 8 million dollars as in investment. It would need more like 90 billion, just so when the powerhouses do try to attempt either their version or a buy out, then the company would be able to withstand any pressure. It's unfortunate, Google Money(POWER) is $$$ Billions. And, I mean triple digit profit type power. It's one of few in the world value over 100 Billion all by itself. The David and Goliath story could hold true, if they are not greedy or have the financial backing to stave off the powerhouses. And, it's always a pleasure to read you, listen to you and hear from you. :) :D
Hey Holly, interesting hub. However, before this search becomes any issue for Google, who has the most buying power in the World, you can bet, if Google sees it as a problem, then it will simply incorporate it into itself. Competition nowadays is only the powerhouses available. Anything smaller will be eaten up by the powerhouses, if deemed a threat. Again, it's an interesting hub. But, I'm sure the company will be short lived. ;)
24Welcome to the latest column from Whitchurch’s town mayor, Councillor Tony Neville…
Firstly, I would like to thank everyone for coming to the Christmas lights switch-on event, we hope you had a great time.
Our town council team did a great job in putting on another splendid show, including new lights tree-wrapped in the Bullring and, in addition, new lights on the tree near the bus station and Mill Street. Santa sent some fairies to Whitchurch and has let us know their names and door numbers, but we still don’t know where they are living.
Can you help? If so, please pop along to the Civic Centre and pick up the list of names and see if you can find them all for us, then drop the completed forms off at the Community Hub by Thursday, December 21 with your name and phone number.
The first two completed lists drawn out of a hat will win a prize and we will call you on Friday, December 22 to let you know.
Once again congratulations to the council’s Citizen of the Year, Rose Snell. We enjoyed an afternoon tea prior to switching on the Christmas lights and I look forward to working with Rose throughout her coming Citizen of the Year functions.
Our staff at the Civic Centre have also been busy raising money for Save the Children Fund. On Friday, December 15 they all took part in a sponsored cycle ride, with an exercise bike kindly donated for the occasion from Bodytech.
Everyone looked resplendent in their Christmas jumpers and it was great to see the Friday Market folk get involved too.
Just to let everyone know the last market for 2017 will be on Friday, December 22 in the market hall and outside the Civic Centre. So pop in and pick up your fresh meat and eggs, fruit and veg, bread, Christmas cards and wrapping paper, cakes, jam and pickles as well as Christmas wreaths, poinsettia and presents – why not enjoy a cuppa with your friends while you’re there and be sure to say hello to me.
At the last Makers’ Market, the Whitchurch Town Band played some great Christmas tunes, unfortunately they had to cancel their Christmas show on December 10 due to the snow. But watch out for them at the Civic Centre and Jubilee Park in 2018, I am sure there will be more shows.
Come and join us at the Civic Centre New Year’s Eve Party. The Review are playing, along with The Andy Hall Big Show. Tickets are on sale at the Community Hub in the Civic Centre £15 in advance, or just give us a call, we now take all credit and debit cards to make payments easier.
Come and join us to see out the old and bring in the New Year in style – all with a free glass of fizz to toast at midnight. Over 18s only please.
The New Year’s Day Horse Parade, in association with the British Driving Society (Whitchurch Area), will arrive in the town centre at approximately 1pm on Monday, January 1 2018.
The parade will set off from The Raven at Prees Heath at 12.30pm. The horse carriages and their drivers will be received by myself and fellow Town Councillors outside the Civic Centre at 1pm.
I will be handing out the brasses and rosettes to the riders, including a trophy for the best dressed horse and carriage of the day. Come along and join us for this great New Year tradition.
On behalf of Whitchurch Town Council, I wish you all a very Merry Christmas.

Share your opinions onOriginally I was going to use the theme of "instrumentals" this week; however, I've found a couple of other videos that I want to use so the new theme is "music from the 70s."
When I originally thought of "instrumentals," one of the first songs that came to mind was of The Edgar Winter Group's classic Frankenstein. This song was originally released in 1973 on the album They Only Come Out at Night. The song was, in fact, a last minute addition to the album and placed on the B-side of 45-rpm records (the A-side being the song Hangin' Around). However, that changed when word came back from DJs that Frankenstein was the more popular song. The original single that was played on radio was only 4:44 long; however, this version, from a 1973 broadcast of the Old Grey Whistle Test, is over twice as long, at 9:12. In this recording, Edgar Winter shows his musical versatility by playing a synthesizer, saxophone and the drums.- published: 31 Jan 2014

Peter Connelly (also known as "Baby P", "Child A", and "Baby Peter") was a 17-month-old English boy who died in London after suffering more than fifty injuries over an eight-month period, during which he was repeatedly seen by the London Borough of Haringey Children's services and National Health Service (NHS) health professionals. Baby P's real first name was revealed as "Peter" on the conclusion of a subsequent trial of Peter's mother's boyfriend on a charge of raping a two-year-old. His full identity was revealed when his killers were named after the expiry of a court anonymity order on 10 August 2009.
The case caused shock and concern among the public and in Parliament, partly because of the magnitude of Peter's injuries, and partly because Peter had lived in the London Borough of Haringey, North London, under the same child welfare authorities that had already failed seven years earlier in the case of Victoria Climbié. That had led to a public inquiry which resulted in measures being put in place in an effort to prevent similar cases happening.

Watch the full episode here: Professor Ray Jones, professor of social work at Kingston University and St George's University London and author of 'The Story of Baby P', talks to Going Underground host Afshin Rattansi about child protection measures in the wake of the Baby P scandal. He points to a media campaign by The Sun and others vilifying the social workers involved, which was picked up by David Cameron among others.

Elizabeth South Driving LessonsWorking in a medical institution for twenty 8 years equipped me with insights on what occurs after we get previous and are institutionalized. Something that has made a global of distinction to these residing in hospitals and establishments has been puppy treatment. Pet treatment’s number one function is to offer social and sensory stimulation for the aged and for the unwell; a consult with from a significant other animal supply alternatives for recollecting, reviewing and discussions of losses.
Aging isn’t unique to the elderly. It is a long-term procedure that starts, some other folks say, originally of the lifestyles cycle itself. It’s mentioned that we spend one quarter of our lifestyles rising up and 3 quarters of lifestyles rising previous.
Aging in our tradition is frequently perceived as a sequence of losses: if it is power, well being, independence, sensory acuity, monetary safety would possibly all decline. Our social losses upload to this enjoy. Spouses of the aged would possibly cross into establishments or soak up place of dwelling in age- segregated housing. Eventually pals of older other folks begin to die.
Younger members of the family could have moved away or, on the very least, have established separate lives and houses of their very own. What previous age does is to accentuate and pay attention the losses and declines that have frequently been in procedure for years and many years.
Institutionalization for other folks over 65 years of age is basically because of other folks’s bodily and cognitive impairment.
Mobility, social contacts, contact, and different varieties of sensory stimulation would possibly all be decreased as a results of institutional lifestyles. The losses that aged other folks have skilled give a contribution the form to their discussion, their our bodies, and the attitudes they convey to undergo at the social actions given to them in nursing houses.
Companion-animal visits produce a vary of various responses from other folks. Those who make a selection to narrate to the pets and volunteers increase an expectation or want for ongoing contacts with the similar people and animals.
In the process visits, conversations, and the rising relationships between common volunteers and citizens deliver up a huge gamut of subjects and issues. In many instances the pets who’ve served to deliver other folks in combination fade into the background after a number of periods, and citizens relate to the team of workers and guests who accompany the animals.
Issues raised are across the climate, fresh vacations, into extra non-public ones equivalent to circle of relatives members of the family, clinical issues in addition to the forbidden subjects of non secular ideals and politics.
They additionally frequently make a selection to speak all the way through the periods concerning the bonds and losses they have got skilled with people and animals. Pet visits conjure up recollections from early life and different lifestyles phases that give a contribution to the integrative technique of recalling for the aged.
Stories centering on animals frequently identification key options of other folks’s organic households, the standard in their marriages and of the binds to their youngsters, their histories are laced with tales of ways pets have entered into their lives. One consult with with a canine can do all this, superb! Better than any drugs it’s good to give a unhappy or lonely particular person.
Since such recalling has been proven to be the most important way for older other folks to create a profound account in their lives, significant other –animal periods encourages within the excitement of this activity. Pets are symbolic of the extra entire home enjoy that citizens as soon as loved.
Many seniors regard their former pets as having been “members of the family”. They search out and emphasize the bodily resemblances between visiting animals and the pets they as soon as needed to surrender, in addition to with the members of the family recently taking care of them. Sessions additionally supply alternatives for other folks to reward, criticize, and discover different home ties. They draw connections between human loss and puppy loss; via those connections they often confront problems with loss of life and morality.
Seniors take pleasure in and occasionally take credit score for the lengthy lives of animals they have got owned. In recalling pets from the previous, on the very starting of conversations, some sufferers talk about the circumstance in their animal’s deaths. Facts detailing their relationships in most cases observe. They additionally talk about deaths and the burials in really extensive element.
Details which might be actual, graphic and emotional aren’t forgotten when explaining animal losses that befell a number of many years ahead of. My mom who passed on to the great beyond may in conversations keep in mind names and scenarios 50 years again. She may keep in mind her first canine and my first canine. This won’t appear sudden, aside from for the truth that she suffered from reminiscence loss and rarely spoke.
Discussions of those reports with pets permit sure people to proportion their very own grief or their fears of human loss. Some other folks emphasize the finality of sure forms of attachment and loss. Describing a courting with a explicit animal with which they had been extraordinarily shut, and after whose loss of life they had been not able to tackle any other puppy.
Deceased pets also are remembered and spoken of as resources of ethical worth. They are praised for giving and eliciting love, for demonstrating loyalty and agree with for educating other folks learn how to care and be type and for providing alternatives to have interaction in lifestyles in a certain manner.
Companion animal visits be offering seniors alternatives for dialog, sensory stimulation, tactile heat, and ongoing relationships with others , the effectiveness of those visits derives partly from the symbolic meanings and the fears, hopes, values and identities that folks venture onto puppy animals in our tradition . Such recollections are a essential a part of other folks’s reconstruction in their non-public histories.
Not to say the sensation and nice pleasure of passing via lifestyles once more and sharing ones recollections with others. When it’s my flip, I will be able to have such a lot of recollections and tales to inform, I will be able to additionally really feel the ache once more for my loss, the cost of that fab pleasure, is the ache I think when now.
Dogs have fulfilled my lifestyles with function and that means, who may ask for the rest extra.

That is because they all received the same bad input from their sources. How did this happen? Was there just one source? Did this source get the date wrong on purpose? It sure made for one hell of a Russian collusion story based on the wrong date given about the Wikileaks sourcing. Here is a criticism that is greatly deserved, from one of their own. Be sure and watch the video.
As Written By and For Breitbart News:
Liberal journalist Glenn Greenwald writes at the The Intercept that CNN’s blatantly false report that Wikileaks (and thus Russia) had been caught attempting to collude with the Trump campaign before the release of the trove of DNC emails was the start of “one of the most embarrassing days for the U.S. media in quite a long time.” The fake news was hyped all over television and the Internet, especially by MSNBC. Outlets eventually corrected their respective reports, but how such a mistake was possible remains a mystery. From his article:

103 ECTS credits and few other gigs
My last year as a students seems to be soon over and my second Bachelor degree completed. This 9 months in Oulu have been really busy. One year ago in Tallinn I was thinking about this year. I actually thought I would have more time for hobbies. But now I realize that I completed over 60 ECTS credits (that is normal for one year studies), I’m not wondering that I felt running from one place to another.
There has been many interesting things like project called Particle Plays, a gig in Russia, Ruskatrööttä wind orchestra event in Rantasalmi, FISOC projects in Oulu and Piteå, applying to the competition Concours Debussy in Paris, gigs in Kempele, Rovaniemi, Sodankylä and Kemi, my first real audition in Oslo, Mozart’s Clarinet Quintet, Sonate by Brahms, lots of teaching kids, one more thesis, slowly begininng working in Oulu city teather, and finally my clarinet exam last week.
Of course I’ve also met lots of new friends and other people and got to know city of Oulu with it’s many cultural activities.
The summer is finally coming. I have no clear plans yet, but for sure I will be playing. Next autumn is also already in my mind while I will try to plan how to combine working in the teather and teaching in Kokkola. But I can say that I’m happy to have job in my own field.
FISOC Project in Piteå, Sweden & Clarinet exam next week
Spring time is the busy time. Finally my thesis is ready and soon I will publish it here too. It means I have also more time to write this blog.
May started fine with a wonderful trip to Piteå, Sweden. We had symphony orchestra project with Festivo International meaning the symphony orchestra brought together students from Oulu, Kristiansand (Norway) and Piteå. We had four days before concert to put together Piano Concerto nr. 2 by Rachmaninov and Organ symphony by Saint-Saëns. I played only in Saint-Saëns so for me those four days were also a break with the teaching the clarinet. I had finally time to practice myself! Lovely.
Of course orchestra playing was great too. I met some people I had got to know already earlier in November 2013 when we had our first project together but I also got to know lots of knew people and spent time with friends from Oulu too. The rooms might have been a bit cold but the atmosphere trhoughout the project was warm and happy. It is really important to give these opportunities for young musicians to work together with people from other countries. We also enjoyed a flute concert/exams by our students from Oulu one night.
When coming back to Finland I also realized that my exam will be already next week. I’m feeling quite excited about it but maybe also little bit nervous. I still have many things to do before next Wednesday and also things that keep me away from the playing.
Anyway, I try to remind myself that it is going to be a really nice concert and I wish my audience to enjoy it. Then it will be easier to forget that it is the final exam. And finally I can wear my beautiful dress!
It is possible to follow the concert live from anywhere in the world via Internet live streaming.Abstract-46.
BACKGROUND: The influence of coronary collateral vessels on infarct size in humans remains controversial, partly because no previous study has examined the impact of collaterals present at the onset of acute myocardial infarction on infarct size.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study used the data base of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Phase I trial to correlate the presence or absence of angiographically documented collaterals in the initial hours of myocardial infarct evolution with the size of the infarct as assessed by serial measurements of serum creatine kinase (CK). To avoid the confounding effects of reperfusion on enzymatic estimates of infarct size, this report is limited to those 125 patients who failed to recanalize at 90 minutes after administration of tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase. Patients with angiographically documented collaterals (group A, n = 51) had significantly lower values of peak serum CK than patients without collaterals (group B, n = 74) (1,877 +/- 216 versus 2,661 +/- 212 IU/l, respectively [mean +/- SEM], p = 0.004). Similarly, CK-derived infarct size estimates were significantly lower in group A than in group B (20.6 +/- 2.5 versus 31.4 +/- 2.8 CK gram equivalents, p = 0.001). The infarct size observed in patients with collaterals was less for anterior infarctions as well as for infarctions of other locations; thus, the beneficial effects of collaterals were independent of the site of the infarct. In 65 of the 125 patients who failed to reperfuse, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed by contrast ventriculography both at initial cardiac catheterization (before thrombolytic therapy) and at hospital discharge. Among the patients who had both studies, global LVEF tended to increase from pretreatment to hospital discharge in group A (from 50.6 +/- 1.8% to 53.4 +/- 1.8%, p = 0.10) but decreased in group B patients (from 50.3 +/- 1.8% to 47.8 +/- 1.7%, p = 0.02). At hospital discharge, global LVEF was greater in patients with coronary collaterals (53.5 +/- 1.7% versus 49.6 +/- 1.7%, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that, in patients in whom thrombolytic therapy fails to induce reperfusion, the presence of coronary collateral vessels at the onset of myocardial infarction is associated with limitation of infarct size as assessed enzymatically and with improved ventricular function on discharge as assessed by LVE..
However, there’s also an aimlessness to the novel that proves its greatest weakness. Characters cross paths only briefly, unwinding into their own narratives some of which feel important, and some of which don’t. Pero, as the thematic centre alongside Danica, just isn’t as interesting as she is, and isn’t as fun to hang around with as his thematic predecessor, Crispin, was. It’s a lot of wandering that sometimes failed to keep my attention and sometimes failed to keep me caring about the people involved.
Children of Earth and Sky is a satisfying, thoughtful read, but one that suffers in relation to the duology it explicitly references and builds on.
Mythago Wood – Robert Holdstock (1984)
Stephen returns to his home after the second world war and the death of his estranged father, a man obsessed with the ancient woodland on their estate. Mythago Wood is rightly considered a classic, and is the most thorough exploration of an idea that seems common among European fantasy authors of the 1940s-1990s: where pockets of the primeval woodland that once covered the continent now hold human consciousness/myth within them. Wandering into an old-growth forest becomes a literal form of time-travel, and legendary creatures and figures still make their home there, unaware of the passing years. You find that motif most obviously in Tolkien’s Old Forest and Mirkwood. Here, it’s more explicit: if you follow the right paths, the small forest becomes the edge of a much larger one, and at its centre is the way to the ice age and humankind’s earliest prehistory. Beyond it lies a place purified from the pain and suffering we have wrought.
Compelling stuff, but getting there is a thorny task. Stephen’s impetus to penetrate to the heart of the wood is his love for Guiwenneth, a woman born out of English myth who serves as the template for Guinevere and others. Their relationship is idealized in a way that I ultimately disliked: I saw no good reason Guiwenneth would be attracted to Stephen beyond that she has to be for the purposes of the story. I am all for characters of vastly different cultures and mindsets coming to understand each other and form strong bonds (see: The Left Hand of Darkness), but that process is very one-sided in Mythago Wood, and the conclusion is that their bond is shared because Guiwenneth came partially from Stephen’s fevered imaginings. That same reasoning worked beautifully in Solaris, not so much here, but it does lead to something beautiful: the long trek through the endless forest that makes up the last portion of the novel.
The same ideas about the woodland in Mythago Wood are now more commonly (and surprisingly) found in urban fantasies today. Neverwhere has secret pathways in London leading to a much larger mythscape within it and spawned a whole set of “magic London” novels by other authors operating on the same principles. The urban side of this setting has been successfully replicated by North American fantasy authors, but I don’t find the same reverence for the forest as a holding-place for human memory. For whatever reason, we didn’t (and don’t) have the same conception of the forest, perhaps because we still have so much of it. While American and Canadian authors have tried to incorporate the notion of the greenwood in their fiction, I’ve never felt they believed it in the way that Holdstock and his contemporaries did.
I’ve often thought reading Lord Dunsany that he “gets” the outdoors in a way a lot of fantasy writers don’t, which I’m inclined to think is because he had so much more experience of the woods and the countryside than most people living today do.
There is a definite disconnect between most American fantasy involving outdoor travel written by people who’ve never even gone camping before (though I think that has a lot to do with publishing being focused in urban centres and the necessities of networking). Couple that with the current sense that “serious” writing is writing about the city and you get a double-layer of falseness in how many popular authors write about nature.
Sounds about right.Remember the story of Yavapai prize soccer recruit Angus Eve not showing up at Sky Harbor Airport when coach Mike Pantalione went to pick him up?
Eve apparently became a soccer player with cold feet, but one unable to dial a telephone.
Shortly thereafter, Eve's replacement, Hakim Bakhti, took four different flights from Morocco to Phoenix in order to make the Roughriders' initial practice.
Bakhti scored the first goal in Sunday's title game.
There's got to be a message in there somewhere.
[excerpt].
Here’s a mom who was in having a difficult time at her son’s grave with tears streaming down her face and then, she received a ‘sign’ from above.
Sometimes, these signs are much more than a mere coincidence and they truly leave people wondering if their beloved deceased is trying to tell them something. On April 1, Marie Robinson of Waterlooville, England experienced something inexplicable when she went to visit her son’s gravesite..
If you believe in animal symbolism, you can probably reflect on many moments in life that you received a ‘sign’ from above. A robin is usally a sign of renewal and spring. It’s a sign of hope, clarity, simplicity and new beginnings.
For Marie, although I can’t imagine losing a child, especially at the young age of four, God sent her a sign from above. The sign was a robin. Knowing that her son, Jack, enjoyed robins, it seems natural then that a robin would be sent to her to express happiness and joy, and maybe even encouraging her it’s a new spring, a new day, and a new beginning. Marie was being sent a ‘sign’ from above to start enjoying life because each day is a gift to cherish, and moving forward things in life will get brighter for Marie and her family.
Do you think the robin was a ‘sign’ from above? Let us know in the comments if you’ve ever received a ‘sign’ from above during a difficult time in your life.
And if your curious about animal symbolism,.Recently I made a mistake. I did not resist the urge to leap into a Facebook back-and-forth about the coal industry, the environment, and most importantly, the economy. You don’t have to be a native West Virginian to be troubled by what is going on, but I am both native and troubled. Status update soundbites can never give justice to the dynamics and complexities of West Virginia’s agonizing, heel-digging resistance to even talking about life outside the colonial economy of coal.
We need to talk about one thing above all others, and that is how seemingly impossible and yet absolutely necessary it is for our state to stop defining ourselves by a fading economy. I saw a quote today on the side of a building, it said, “You must do the things you think you cannot do.” Eleanor Roosevelt said this, and it is used in a wide range of human circumstances. West Virginia would do well to take these words to heart.
I am unaware of any other industry or profession where people are not expected to do what everyone else has to do, and that is figure out how to be employable in more than one field. It’s extremely difficult, but we all have to do it. Some people talk about coal miners as if they are some unique category of people who never have to adapt and figure out how to be relevant in a changing economy and find new work, ever. Underneath that way of thinking is a condescending attitude that they aren’t like everyone else because they aren’t smart enough or tough enough or modern enough or something. It drives me crazy because just the opposite is true.
If you want tough and adaptable and curious and indomitable, you want a West Virginia coal miner. These folks eat my fears for breakfast, and negotiate circumstances so deadly day after day it would finish most of us within 24 hours. There are families in West Virginia that go back generations who are built on the genetic and character codes of this kind of work, so please, don’t condescend to them. Ever. Not even for a vote.
The trouble is, while West Virginia’s future rests on the cannot-be-defeated nature of miners, what it does not rest on is out-of-state coal companies. This post is not about coal companies, but most people are aware that their reputations are much less glowing than the reps of miners themselves. Let’s leave it at that.
In my Facebook comments, I compared the dynamics of the economic transitions ahead of us to the shock to the Old South with the end of plantations where the production was almost entirely from a system of slave labor. That was not a wise thing to pop up in a few lines in a real-time conversation, because it is so easily misunderstood. In no way am I comparing slavery to coal mining. I do believe, however, that there are valid opportunities to see West Virginia’s economic issues through the lens of the Old South if one can stay focused on the transition problems. I maintain they are relevant and potentially useful in bridging the gaps in public dialogue around us every day.
The language similarities are striking when thinking about comparisons between the Old South agricultural empire and West Virginia’s extractive industry economy . Threats to “our way of life” are common cries. People bring up their family trees, how long their family has been part of a work culture, and how the nation depends on the product to survive. Patriotism and morality are questioned. Families and friendships are strained and in some cases broken. Some people talk about the President of the United States as if he is an enemy of the state, and there is constant pressure to not say the wrong thing so as not to be labeled disloyal — to what, take your pick. You risk being disloyal to your beloved state and the commitment and even sacrifice of generations of miners if you question anything about the impact of the coal industry, and you risk being disloyal to your own children’s health and well-being for a few bucks if you don’t chain yourself to a tree.
Something’s gotta give.
It starts with talking about one thing with a laser sharp focus: The New Economy. No one stopped needing food and fibers when abolition became law, and no one is going to stop needing electricity when mountain top removal and even coal mining itself is no more. We must focus on what we need, and how we will continue to get it through new methods that meet the new information we have about the destructive contamination inherent in coal mining. Really smart people I’ve known all my life are turning a blind eye to what everyone outside of West Virginia knows without even trying — coal ash, mercury poisoning, degradation of streams and elimination of entire ecosystems are poised to do more than inconvenience a few fish. Even the most stubborn person out there has got to know in his or her heart that this is insanity.
We need to stop letting the coal industry define this debate. The WV Coal Association has one of the nicest, kindest men you will ever meet as its spokesman, and it does not matter. Personalities need to disappear from the conversation. I started by saying I am a native West Virginian, and that comes with a big guarantee — I will never give up on this place. I do everything I can to keep the conversation on a high level, but also on a level that matters. At the end of the day, in the Old South it did not matter, not even a little bit, how long anyone ran their farms a certain way. It needed to end, and people needed to have a higher vision for what they could do, how, and why. It took a Civil War and the near end of this country for people to get a clue.
Let’s not make the same mistakes.

In 1987 Danny moved to New York City and quickly discovered that it was truly the city that never sleeps. He found himself lying awake at nights, unable to sleep, tormented by the constant chaos that lurked just outside his bedroom window. Quite unexpectedly, he discovered meditation, and soon found himself sleeping like a baby.
Now, with 30 years of study and practice, he enjoys great powers of concentration, breathing control, and expanded awareness. His understanding of meditation comes from a combination of philosophies, technologies, and various life experiences. Without meditation, not only would sleep be elusive, but he is sure he would have ended up in the nearest insane asylum!
Danny currently teaches at Sanctuary for Yoga, Body, and Spirit in Nashville, Tennessee.

Wouldn week – SFR, PNR and FantasyR – and the many sources I use (including authors sending me information) I do get a feel for what may be ‘hot’ soon. Reverse harem stories for one. I’ve been seeing a gradual increase in the number of them across all genres and in fact just interviewed some RH authors for my USA Today Happy Ever After platform. Definitely a growing favorite with a lot of readers.
Dragon shifters – I saw that one coming and sure enough, every week I have more and more dragon-themed stories. There are certain authors I watch (my little trade secret) and I have no idea how they figure it out, but if one of them suddenly starts releasing novels with a purple penguin shifter hero (to be ridiculous), I’ll know that’s the next hot place to be if you’re trying to write to market. In all honesty, I think the dragon craze may have been helped by the popularity of the character Daenarys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons in the ‘Game of Thrones’ TV series. Always a good idea to pay heed to what’s being presented and getting a lot of buzz in the movies and on TV.
Time travel is on a slight uptick…hello, ‘Outlander’….and probably also due to many really well done historical programs which are piquing reader interest in past times.
I’m seeing a new trend right now, of using the standard tropes from category romance – secret babies, billionaires, stepbrothers, fake fiancées and on and on – and just moving them bodily over to the SFR and PNR genres. And putting all those key words right into the title!
I hear whispers that cozy SFR will be next and when you figure that formula out, let me know because I want to write something that can have one of those adorable cozy covers! I do think the Ilona Andrews Innkeeper series could almost fall into this category. It’ll be interesting to see how ‘cozy’ gets redefined for scifi romance if it happens.
And I’m betting on the continued popularity of fairy tales and the whole “marry a prince” trope, thanks to Harry and Meghan.
I don’t write to market, as it happens. I write what I write – that’s what my Muse presents to me to put on the paper (or into the computer) and what I enjoy reading the most as well, so I’m only an observer of these specific trends. The nice thing about being independently published is that if I did want to try to jump on a hot trend, I have the flexibility to do so and get a properly edited book out in 4-6 weeks, versus the much longer timetable at a trad pub house. And once established, a popular subgenre like cyborg romances tend to remain favorites with readers for a long time and as they evolve, creative authors think of new twists and fun developments to keep the stories fresh.
What trend do you see coming? Or wish would take off with readers?
There was fortune telling of a different sort in my most recent scifi romance, The Fated Stars, with my hero Samell being an alien empath held captive and forced to deliver fake fortunes while he was actually spying. Here’s a short excerpt from the book where Samell and Larissa, my kickass space mercenary heroine, are discussing what he does. The conversation is taking place mind to mind, in a dream. Samell is speaking
“The most venerated legends of my race are about warriors and priestesses, and the noble deeds they accomplished together. Rarely, if ever, do the stories feature a priest and a female warrior, although we’ve had many famous women fighters in our history. You intrigued me, Larissa Channer, on many levels.”
“You can cut the flattery—it doesn’t work on me. Better men than you have tried.”
He surveyed her from head to toe with open admiration. “Their loss.”
“I’m gonna wake myself up in a minute, if you continue this chatter. Or touch me again without my permission, even in a dream.” She took a deep breath because despite her stern warning, she was craving his touch and wanted to run her hands freely over his body. Her attraction to him was scary in intensity, so unlike her. “Stick to the facts.”
“As you prefer. I told you the truth—I’m a prisoner and Kinterow forces me to do his bidding. I extract information from certain minds, as the controller commands. I deliver meaningless ‘fortunes’ to anyone who enters the tent, based on what my power to read emotions tells me the person most wants to hear.”
“So you’re a telepathic empath.”
“You can categorize my gifts from Thuun as you wish.”
“Why did you lie to the sheriff? Why didn’t you take the chance I gave you?” She couldn’t keep the bitterness out of her tone. “You let me take big risks for nothing.”
“I’m one of many kidnapped from my world. Kinterow threatened the lives of the others if I said anything but what he commanded to the sheriff. He says he holds many Tulavarran imprisoned.”
“Did you ever consider he could be lying?”
Samell leaned closer. “He also threatened to have you killed in the prison if I disobeyed.”
She snorted. “I’d like to have seen him try.”

Spam will be deleted.This weekend at High Point Solutions Arena in Hamden, Connecticut brought unrelenting excitement to the world of college hockey. Top-ranked Quinnipiac squared off against ninth-ranked Cornell in a gritty three games series to determine who will advance to the ECAC Tournament semifinals. Still riding their top ranking in the USCHO Poll and PairWise Rankings, the Bobcats were heavily favored in this match-up. But it’s always important to remember that the playoffs are a completely different animal. The Bobcats were reminded of this after they dropped the first game of the series 3-2, putting them in a must-win position going into the next game.
Junior Connor Jones opened the scoring for the Bobcats in the first period of Game 1 with a power play goal, giving Quinnipiac an early 1-0 lead. Cornell Freshman Brian Ferlin quickly erased the deficit in the third, scoring a power play goal himself to tie the game at 1 apiece just 23 seconds into the period. Kellen Jones answered minutes later with a goal set up by Matt Peca and Loren Barron. Things quickly went south for the Bobcats as Cornell scored once more at the 5:34 mark with a goal from Madison Dias, and another, the game-winner from Brian Ferlin once again. Quinnipiac put forth a valiant effort in Game 1 but couldn’t squeeze another one past a red-hot (and injured) Andy Iles.
Game 2 was a different story. The Bobcats came out flying from the get-go, potting 2 goals in the first, one from Connor Jones and the other from freshman Travis St. Denis. But in the second the Bobcats put the pedal to the floor, putting together a 7-goal period. Cornell struggled with a goaltending situation as they pulled Iles for backup Omar Kanji only to restart Iles in the third. St. Denis grabbed his second of the night early, followed by goals from Matthew Peca, Cory Hibbeler, Ben Arnt, Kellen Jones (2), and Jordan Samuels-Thomas. Quinnipiac lead 9-0 after 2 periods, completely demoralizing the Big Red. As if that wasn’t enough, defenseman Zach Tolkinen tallied his first goal of the season and the tenth goal of the game for the Bobcats when he blasted one past Andy Iles at 15:20 of the third.
With a do-or-die sitting before them in Game 3, the Bobcats faced the daunting task of following up such an incredible high after a high-scoring affair. More importantly, they faced the task of proving why they’re the best in the country. Cornell made a statement that they came to play when Braden Birch game flying into the zone and scored just 48 seconds in the game. The Bobcats of the first period looked similar to the team in Game 1; the effort was there but the puck wasn’t finding the net.
Quinnipiac finally answered almost 10 minutes into the second when Zach Tolkinen found twine, blasting one past a screened Andy Iles to tie up the game at 1-1. Unfortunately, this was short lived when none other than Brian Ferlin sniped one past Eric Hartzell just minutes later.
The rest of the game was tight and frustrating. Both teams saw their fair share of chances throughout the course of the third. One thing was for certain; Quinnipiac was slowly running out of time to potentially send this thing to overtime as they watched the chances of their first ECAC title begin to slip from their grasp. The Bobcats pushed hard until the final minutes of the third period, and this effort paid off when Clay Harvey got one past the Big Red net-minder with only little over a minute to play. The Bank exploded with noise. But everyone in that building knew it wasn’t over just yet. This game was heading to overtime.
The full fifteen-minute intermission gave the players time to get much needed rest and preparation for arguably one of the biggest hockey periods of their career. From the puck drop at the start of the first overtime period, Quinnipiac was controlling the pace. The Bobcats made strong defensive plays in front of Hartzell and had fantastic opportunities to end this once and for all, but the team struggled to find the back of the net.
Eighty minutes just wasn’t enough time to settle the score between these two as the game was sent into double overtime. The strategy looked relatively similar for both teams as they entered the second overtime; Cornell dumped the puck into the zone frequently, this approach could partially be due to the fact that they were rolling only 4 defenseman all weekend and were probably running out of gas. But neither team was showing any signs of quitting.
Fourth line senior Kevin Bui saw a few chances to finish this game toward the end, bringing an energy and grittiness to the ice that was much needed for this Bobcat team. And then came the golden goal. After a sweet pass from senior Loren Barron, Bui came motoring into the zone. Bui with the Cornell d-man beat put the puck on his backhand a slid one right through the five-hole of Andy Iles. The fans erupted once again as the Bobcats came pouring out onto the ice to celebrate. Equipment was flying, the glass was rattling, and Cornell players lie defeated on the ice.
Bui, an unlikely hero, just lifted the team into the ECAC Tournament semifinals.
The Bobcats were going to Atlantic City.
This Friday, Quinnipiac will square off against the Brown Bears at 4:00 in New Jersey. The winner of this match-up will face either Yale or Union in the ECAC Championship.
In a weekend of line brawls, high-scoring affairs and high-drama, the Bobcats emerged victorious and lived to see another day.

Seems like a great thing to store and update all your stuff in one easy place, but is there any reason to believe it could possibly be safe? Although I guess a lot of things are storing your data in the cloud. I am clueless on this stuff. I did not know any of the websites that came up giving it good reviews.

Well this past weekend we had mild weather and very sunny days, so I decided to break out my contact printing frame I got for Christmas and try my hand at cyanotypes again.
I did a few tests with Arches Platine and Cover/Velin and decided I liked the Cover/Velin best for the negatives I have. I did a few with 2 very light coats, and one with 2 moderate coats, brushed on and allowing each coat to dry thoroughly in between. I used the same digital negatives that I had from the Ziatype workshop (I probably need to make some more for future experiments). I also did a few direct prints from my 4×5 negatives, but I wasn’t all that happy with the results of those with this process.
I think personal ideal would be someplace between these last two. I like the rich blue of the longer exposure with the 2 moderate coats, but it is far too contrasty for my tastes. Then again the original photo had a fair amount of contrast, but I think I could alter the curve on the digital negative and get better results.Liverpool loanee Mario Balotelli is still battling with a troublesome groin injury at Serie A giants AC Milan.
The striker missed the Rossoneri's draw with Atalanta at the San Siro over the weekend and no timeline has been given for his return.
The 25-year-old managed one goal in three appearances for Milan before suffering the groin injury last month and has not been seen on the pitch since early October.The Steam Controller is now available for preorder, as we mentioned last week, along with Steam Link, the wireless gizmo that gives you access to your Steam stuff on any television in the house, and a couple of Steam Machines, too. Initial quantities will be limited, however, and distributed on a first-come, first-served basis, beginning on October 16, "weeks in advance of our official launch." And the numbers are already ticking down.
"The 'get it early' preorder offer is available to everyone who preorders, but only while supplies last," Valve warned in an update sent out today. "As of this writing, we have sold over 35 percent of the limited quantity available for early delivery in October."
The implication is obviously that these things are going quickly, and if you don't lay your money down soon, you could well find yourself out of luck. Valve hasn't released the actual numbers, though, nor how the percentage of preorders came about—if there was a massive flood on the first day that's dwindled to a trickle, or if it's been a steadily increasing rate since preorders began. It also bears mentioning that the usual risks of preorders apply; it's not likely that Valve will churn out flimsy crapola, but we won't be able to say for sure what they've cooked up until this hardware is actually on the market.
Valve also clarified that all Steam Machines will support In Home Streaming, in addition to native Steam OS games. "This means they can transmit and receive In Home Streams, and allows them to play all the games on Steam when paired with Steam PC," Valve said. Steam Machines won't officially go on sale until November, but Valve added that preview and review units will be made available later this summer.Christmas time is here!

If you are a dancer, you might also be hearing Christmas music being played frequently at your dance studio (It honestly feels like we have been playing holiday tunes since September!).

Sacred Heart University has named Father Michael Ramos as director of Campus Ministry and chaplaincy. Prior to joining Sacred Heart, Ramos served as parochial vicar at St. Joseph Church in New Paltz, N.Y., and held parish roles in Vermont and Massachusetts.
Ramos says he was happy to join the SHU community, although he knew it would be difficult to move on from “the wonderful people” at his previous parish. “Since coming to Sacred Heart University, I have been impressed with the students as a whole and those who are involved in campus ministry in particular,” he says.
His extensive background in education includes serving as associate superintendent of schools at the Archdiocese of New York, adjunct professor at Fordham University and principal, certified teacher and associate superintendent at various other institutions for 30 years. He holds doctorate in education (Ed.D.) from Seton Hall University, a master’s degree in theology from St. John’s University and a master of divinity degree from Boston College School of Theology and Ministry, plus multiple degrees in education and educational leadership. He is an ordained priest through the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin.
Ramos spent his first days as director of campus ministry getting acquainted with the community and raising awareness about spiritual life offerings at SHU. “My initial priorities have been to get to know the students and faculty and to help them know what campus ministry has to offer,” he says.
He adds that he has been working with campus ministry staff to create a “collaborative ministry that enhances present programs while creating new ones and continuing to respond to the needs of our students.”
He also hopes to get more students involved in campus ministry. “My next goals are to continue to evaluate our programs so that we will attract even more students and to help students understand their own giftedness and how they can use these gifts in service to one another and to the world,” he says. “Ultimately, I hope that all members of the Sacred Heart Community will comprehend the tremendous love that God has for them.”NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Accenture (NYSE:ACN) has been named a leader in the inaugural IDC MarketScape for Worldwide Cloud ERP Implementation Services (Doc #US41523417), excelling in the two primary categories: Strategies and Capabilities.
The report, the first of its kind from an analyst firm, evaluated 11 providers on a range of criteria, with a heavy emphasis on the input of cloud ERP Implementation Services buyers. IDC defines ERP Implementation Services as the IT consulting and systems integration services required to implement the SaaS versions of F&A, HR, SCM/Procurement, PPM and CRM application suites. When IDC asked buyers what characteristics were important for a cloud ERP implementation services project to be successful at a worldwide level, the top two characteristics were "ability to achieve desired business outcomes" and "meets the project timeline."
In making its assessment, IDC highlighted the breadth and depth of Accenture’s cloud services portfolio. IDC also pointed to Accenture’s ability to provide industry, functional, and technical insights and competence to achieve desired business outcomes and provide vertical-specific product/services solutions. The strength of Accenture’s cloud ERP strategy and functionality roadmap – including plans to increase offerings for cloud ERP implementation services across all ERP functions, major regions and industries – was a critical factor in the firm’s placement.
Buyers rated Accenture highly for its ability to optimize the mix of onshore/offshore efforts needed on a project. Similarly, IDC rated Accenture highly for the pace and productivity of its innovation/R&D.
“Accenture is a leader in global cloud ERP implementation services, offering clients a wider range of consulting and implementation services, with an emphasis on business as well as technology change,” said Ali Zaidi, research director, IT Consulting and Systems Integration Business Strategies at IDC. “Accenture should be on the shortlist where users are looking for an optimal balance of onshore, nearshore, and offshore recurves; where they are looking to integrate cloud ERP solutions with on-premise solutions; and where they seek tight project management including deadline discipline.”
“In addition to innovation, our clients are challenged on how to scale their core businesses using digital technologies or risk becoming obsolete. This report on Accenture’s cloud ERP expertise affirms that we have the right people, processes and technology in place to help our clients successfully transform their complex environments into high-performance engines,” said Paul Daugherty, chief technology & innovation officer at Accenture.
Accenture has made several notable acquisitions in the cloud ERP space over the last several years, including Workday services partner DayNine and Salesforce implementers, such as Phase One, Media Hive, New Energy Group, CRMWaypoint, Cloud Sherpas, Tquila and ClientHouse. Accenture’s dedicated ERP practices include:
- Oracle: The two companies have teamed together for more than two decades, forming the Accenture Oracle Business Group over two years ago to develop and deliver integrated, industry-specific solutions across SaaS, PaaS and IaaS;
- SAP: Accenture has one of the world’s largest SAP practices, delivering projects each year to clients around the globe. Accenture and SAP have collaborated to co-develop and co-innovate on the SAP® Business Suite 4 SAP HANA® and SAP® Leonardo digital innovation system;
- Microsoft: Accenture together with Avanade have the largest Microsoft Dynamics 365 ERP and CRM services team in the world with over 3,000 professionals across 25+ countries, and provide best of breed industry capabilities, IP and scale through their Dynamics 365 Center of Excellence.., September 27th to leave a comment.

June 6, 2013 at 11:07 pmThe cold weather seems to be upon us even though the forecast is for a warmer weekend people are now beginning to dress with layers and turning on the heat in the evenings. I am not so sure I am ready for the cold just yet but there are elements of this season that I really love. It’s a great time to get out several quilts and snuggle under them at night, I love soups and this weather is a perfect excuse to make them, I love sitting in front of my fireplace with handwork or a good book and I especially look forward to the Thanksgiving holiday and getting together with family for the big feast!
Also as you can see from the picture above I have been taking some walks so as not to miss the leaves changing and the nice crisp mornings. Nothing strenuous but a great time to be with friends and enjoy Autumn.
This cooler weather is so perfect for staying indoors and doing some crafting. No knitting for me just yet, although my projects are lined up and waiting for me, but I have been busy sewing and have three quilts in various stages of completion. I am feeling very productive and am so glad to be in my studio for a little while each day. Here is a Christmas quilt I just finished binding and it is now ready to keep me warm through the holidays!!My friend it is of great importance we understand these messages with you for you to have in these moments while we interplay some fabrics within the nominations, the minds in prosperity…
Effects gathered for subliminal contact to adverse effects into greater contact after residual matters are pertained to/with for new effects, states of being indifferently to become possible and advance us more so into the depths of time where we can reach out to new measures, implementations manifestations and technology… Conventional to new ideas or prospects deeming it important within these moments the fabrics of our lives are shifting at large the effects can be gathered for subliminal contacts, supplying limits in dreams where individually we are manifesting codes and prospects in effects to quantum thoughts which disposes the general fabrics of our fields/lives to contemplate advents in frequent measures around the world (Earth).
Probability factors of these coming online has as effects greater chain of events individually being played out for quadrants of this universe set within us (Consciousness) for advancements individually as souls forming out a game…
More so the extents of these lives being lived in more crystallized forms are being pronounced within our dream states for advents being manage on occasions by individuals whom may become keen in the training programs and enable a new “gathering” formal prospects deviated within advances at setbacks.
Conventional programing is becoming at large, greater concepts, exempts in formations above the originating factors in lives beyond this one life experience. What seems impossible to manifest in these days has as effects a greater chain of events being played out individually to help us augment in dimensions (Functions of Space Energy) in contact space. The purposes of these messages may be coming in greater length to give about eventual reaps in successive means by bypassing some “residual effects” of the particle/wave concept/adaptation which is deemed greater in exempts to form something which may become new to us in the near future.
Individually the formations are gathered for new effects to take place while independently… What we call the formations has as effects nominal factors being played out for the eventual reaps, which bypassing the extents of those reaps in some form of reward, sub selecting new advents have as proposals change in frequency from our surrounding implications (events). It sub divides with the inner most parts of our aspects for conventional means to adapt new possibilities, in manifesting choices within our (systems) consciousness at play from surrounding aspects. Which counterpoises after residual effects from the chained events gather within momentum for advances individually in fabrications which can abolish the flows of these impasses (Moments of greater flux)…
Independently these are not conventional to our everyday lives, but query in attributes forming the events in nominations, the factors abolishing the “co-concepts”, individually evolves within the greater fabrics constructed of those/these manifestations while implying events of the greater causes and effects.
Perpetuated fabrics, govern on abilities to predispose events of greater fabrics while complying with events in a meaningful matter contributing to effects at greater dispositions to gather momentum within fabrics of sub selective frequencies/fields. Purposeful attempts to numerate the fall at acquiescence.
Nominal factors playing out integrations for us to ascend over, purposeful attempts to co-create individually gathering some fabrics for evolvements within synapsing currents. The prospects are interactive in devious accounts. What this means has as effects greater contemplations at reminiscing flows which counteracts the proposals at devious accounts. Prospections are deemed unnecessary within these moments for eventual means of greater balance within the fabrics of our minds. What this composes has as effects proposals for attempts to fabricate/numerate the fall… Which independently has quadrants of our known fabrics (Involvements) “realities” in alignments to advance, bring about some achievements in perpetuated fabrics. Conventional means of happing, saying about attributes forming gradual bonds, a reselection process for advancing a soul further in moments where we deemed of some “things” which may have been impossible in moments greater than what we could (Sub Selectively) gather within moments of the “generated flux”.
What composes these instance as having eventual means of reaping rewards, aspects which pertain to the generated fabrics for advancing a soul, soulfully into advents of prosperous events…? Eventual means of gathering momentum within fabrics above all else when we fail to give out this information, which comes about naturally for us to inquire in moments of greater truth. Prospects, in Infinite amounts of trans-compartmentalisations… Having said that attributes forming the greater chain of events is “quantumplated” crystallized within our conscious constructs for evolvements within synapse for eventual reaps… Means of having informational flows grow at large concepts to understand some deviated fabrics.
Purposeful attempts to recreate the fall, we say give about time to realize the numerated fabrics, contentment’s bypassing numerals, efficient means of having attempts to bring about an exchange of energy for gradual resumptions in what we are talking about. The most adequate energy/frequency management for us to understand within these moments in attempts to gather some new fabrics (events) which by implying our intents, from prosperous amounts of an “exchange in energy” we say the prospects where “abandoned” what we mean by this is that the energy, frequency wise was (controverted) in means of having accents* in bounce backs, to eventually stay on track with what was of…
Portending fabrics, we are advancing a soul in further complexities while managing the constructs in nominal factors. These have as effects, recreational adaptations within dream realms. What this pertains to in fabrics advances us to comprehend the standards above all when we fail to advance in prospects of chained events… Contemporary they are seeing this as a bounce back, which means the eventual reaps are causing havoc in perpetuated fields, fabrics which are more likely to happen in advances beyond our current moment. This eventual reap was contended to disbelief which we have adjusted for frequencies to rise in successive attempts, numerating the fall which in acquiescence is purposeful for us to understand accept within deviations formal interdependences which have better connotations available for us to experience/gather.
Aboriginal concepts, we are having trouble manifesting a “Gathering” which composes the individuated blocks of frequencies interplaying consciousness within our perpetuated fields of development/creations. Greater effects are conjoined, after gradually augmenting within dimensional train of thoughts as for the gathering is formal to advance a soul further in constructs. The perpetuated fabrics are advancing individuals whom are reading these manifestations/constructs for biases in metaphysics. What has proposed this channeling (Informational flow) to have gathered momentum (Frequency) for explanations advancements, is above and beyond the nominal factors playing out the background of our lives, but independently these have as effects greater postulations in momentarily deviations/deviated fabrics to contend the disbeliefs of folks whom may be in need of a surplus of “adaptations” to bring about the known consensus of these formations.
NamasteFacebook v. Face-to-Face
I like Facebook. Let me say that up front.
For those of you not familiar with Facebook, it is an on-line social networking phenomenon that allows individuals to connect with other people around the world. It’s easy, fun (and potentially addictive.)
Through Facebook, I’ve been able to connect with friends I’ve not seen in many years. It also provides a way to keep up with family members and local friends, particularly within my church. It allows me a place to post comments, share photos, pass along prayer requests, send virtual gifts such as bumper stickers and “flair” (virtual buttons), link to my blog, join groups and carry on conversations.
Well . . . sort of.
Though I am a fan of Facebook as a networking tool, I’ve come to realize its limitations. For starters, you aren’t looking at your friends face-to-face. You can’t pick up on facial expressions or changes in voice tone. You miss out on body language with its subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) gestures. Oh yeah, we can add smilies (or type in all-caps when we want to shout) but even then our messages might be misconstrued.
In other words, the Facebook experience is insulated and isolated from the real, sometimes messy and awkward, face-to-face interaction. We call that a “degree of separation.” Sometimes that’s good a good thing (the reason that bloggers are often referred to as the “pajamas media”) whereby we can interact with people from the comfort of our homes without worrying about how we’re dressed. That isolation has a down-side however, if our ONLY contact with other people is through an on-line social network. All of us need real face-time with other people. There are times we need a literal shoulder to cry on, a literal pat on the back for encouragement, a literal hug of affection, or a literal fist-bump of camaraderie. Not only do we need to receive these physical touches, we need to spread them – even if it’s just a smile. There are times when bytes of data streaming across a wireless connection are a poor substitute for real flesh and blood contact, non-Photoshopped warts and all.
I’m not advocating closing your Facebook accounts, far from it. I am advocating a healthy balance between virtual connections and the kind that only happens in person.
Now, if you’ll excuse me, someone just sent me a tweet on Twitter.

Another weird FB ‘effect’ is literally the reverse – receiving care / affirmation from near-strangers whom the near-anonymity of FB messaging allows an interesting degree of virtual intimacy – in so far as it mimics being ‘real’ in text. Or rather the near-strangers become unexpectedly closer because of shared confidences, experiences or just affiinity – maybe based on snarky comments or amusing status updates. Like you said, a valuable adjunct to World 1.0, not a substitute.

This is great John, I am glad for facebook to keep up with someone i admire and respect. Facebook has allowed me to connect with my past friendships that I would have lost across the miles. ❤
February 23, 2009 at 10:31 pm
I’m new to Facebook but not new to technology. It’s takes me 3-4 handwritten drafts just to get a note to my daughter’s teacher sometimes. I’m dreading having to hand write the recipes our church is requesting. I have gotten so used to typing everything that I have lost the skill to write. My fingers type must faster than they write and it causes chaos in my brain. I’m thankful I still use capitalization and periods though. Personal contact is imperative for relationships. There have been times when I ground myself from the computer and the TV just so I can attend to other things. The computer and it’s many functions are good but we must maintain a balance.Last night I had the opportunity to hear Rep. Barney Frank speak. He spoke without notes or prompter for approximately 40 minutes. That in itself was pretty amazing. His theme was that by November, things will be looking quite a bit different , and the election will perhaps be much different from the current predictions.
I hope so.
He is quite an amazing man. As I listened to him speak, I began to think of what he must have gone through to bring him to that podium. Let’s see, gay man of the late 50’s or so (I’m guessing here-I haven’t looked up his age), an unusual speech pattern-just those two things could have kept him far away from politics. Instead, he became a member of congress, the chair of a very powerful committee, and the leading liberal voice of the democratic party. It was very inspirational just to think about it.
So many times we allow the labels put on us by society to define us, even to ourselves. If he had done so, he might have worked in a factory or an office. I enjoyed his speech and just the fact that I had the chance to hear it.
This morning I read a blog that listed zodiac signs and the supposed descriptions for each. I am a Virgo. The description includes this statement, “Your purpose in life is to inspire others”. How ironic to see that today.
Let’s be clear-I don’t live to inspire others. In fact, I don’t think I could inspire others. It is certainly not my purpose. I’ve actually been thinking lately of how negative and cynical I have become and that I should be changing my attitude to become more positive in my outlook. That is going to be very challenging for me. Lately, I haven’t felt so positive. Certainly not inspirational to anyone.
When I find something inspirational, it makes me want to be a better person, to push past limitations to obtain a goal that seemed unreachable. A person whom I find inspirational has persevered through hard circumstances, determined to move forward in the face of difficulties.
Could I inspire others? Is it even possible to be inspirational if you have set out to inspire others? I don’t think so. It would lose the purity of the process to have gone into it with a goal of trying to be an inspiration. Further, I don’t believe that there are personality types who are, by definition, inspirational to others. It is more a result of circumstance, not personality, even though some personalities may be more likely to be driven to succeed through difficult times.. I think that truly inspirational people take their challenges and instead of just plowing through them, they turn difficulties to their advantage.
I’m not exactly sure why this theme has been rolling in my head today. In fact, I wasn’t even aware of it until I started to write. Bottom line, I guess, is that I appreciated being able to hear Congressman Frank, and I truly admire him for what he’s lived through in order to be there.
I think anyone who recognizes a change is needed is inspiring. (In your case, having a more positive outlook). It’s not easy to change the staus quo and anyone who sets out to do that gives me the courage to believe I can do it to.
So please, keep living life not trying to inspire and you’ll no doubt impact others!

I am an admirer of Congressman Frank as well for all the reasons you mention.
I think everyone should aspire to greatness, but not in a grand public sense, but in a personal way – being a source of inspiration to people who are close to us, who rely on us and who we care about. Any of us can change the lives of others around us, sometimes just by being there when needed. Sometimes only a simple touch or word is necessary, but it can make all the difference.

Were you at the HHH dinner or did you hear Barney Frank somewhere else?
I didn’t make it this year.
It is pretty easy to be a little negative today, especially when you read that Tom Emmer the Republican candidate for Governor is leading in the polls.
He is more conservative then Tim Pawlenty, our no new taxes Gov who has ignored this state for the last year while he travels the country seeking
supporters for his possible run for President.
The mess over at the capital leads me to feel a little
cynical too.
I hope people wake up before our state is bankrupt.

It was the HHH dinner. First time I’ve gone.
Timmy no-no should be getting his pay docked for every day he’s been gone from the state for other stuff.
Emmer is scary. He may have more trouble getting moderate Repubs to vote for him. He can’t make it through until the election without losing it somewhere along the way and show his true colors. Horner may take away more from him that MAK> We’ll see. I just want it all over with.

Due to smartphones and different small, reasonably priced computer systems, we depend on software to hold out many of our on a regular basis routines. We launch apps to assist us in buying, cooking, socializing, even elevating our children. We follow flip-by-turn GPS instructions. We seek recommendation from advice engines on what to observe, learn, and take heed to. We call on Google, or Siri, to reply our questions and solve our issues. Increasingly more, at work and at leisure, we’re dwelling our lives inside glass cockpits.
The academics and employees have finished an excellent job of guiding and encouraging me on this journey. My teacher, Doug Degraauw has allowed me to excel by making the data relatable and has confirmed patience with me by understanding that everyone absorbs data differently. I come away from class on a regular basis with a way of accomplishment and a feeling that I have made the right selection of career path. Thank you ATC and particularly Doug for the help!

According to Jeffrey Rothstein (2008), the American Automakers have provided blue collar meeting line staff with higher middle class wages. Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda have been in a position to gain market share by building and operating Non-Unionized Plants and practising lean manufacturing (Rothstein, 2008). As of 2008, Ford’s competitor Common Motors plans to lay off sixteen,000 employees and rent entry level staff as a replacement with a view to save four.5 billion dollars annually by the yr 2010 (Rothstein, 2008). Ford can do the same by reorganizing its own workforce and investing in progressive lean manufacturing practices and applied sciences going ahead.On The Fourth Day of Chirstmas …….

I dropped two of my three bags to reserve my table, and went to the counter to place my order. “One tall mint chocolate frappe for here?”, he asked with his ever consistent smile. I returned the smile to my favorite barista and said “Yes, thank you DJ.”
As I took a seat with my drink on hand, I saw that the customer before me left her unfinished coffee sitting on my table. I didn’t mind it as I was focused to start my work urgently. I needed to write a story and send it to my boss come end of day. I was eager and determined not to mess up my first job as a writer. I just had to impress my boss.
But with only sheets full of childish doodles and only fragments of nonsense to be told, I got nothing worth of a story. With four unopened emails from my boss, an empty cup of my drink and only three hours remaining, I still had zero inspiration to write. I stared hopelessly at my coffee-table-turned-work-desk desk that felt too cluttered yet totally empty, just like my mind. Suddenly, my eyes studied the half-full cup of Caffe Americano on my table. I stared at it blankly, wasting forever staring into something that wasn’t even mine to begin with. I managed to snap out of my daze when I heard someone said, “Want me to take care of that?” I watched as DJ took the cold cup away from gaze.
Noticeably, the cup had already left brown, mild stains on my table. How familiar it looked for me. I suddenly remembered how it felt to always have a cup of coffee in my hands. All the things I got to do, with the feeling I was unstoppable. The rush and charge running through my body was magnified. I felt powerful and relentless. The feeling was ecstatic. Motivation and inspiration was never a problem. I was on top of the world and nothing could bring me down. I didn’t want it to stop. I was in love with the feeling it gave me.
But it reminded me why I stopped drinking coffee. It became an addiction. I relied on it too much, I couldn’t write without the bitter taste hanging on my lips. It became so bad it kept leaving stains everywhere. When I tried to remove the stains in my life, I couldn’t wash them all away. How it had left stains on my writings – my words, my echoes of thoughts. My health, my thoughts, my heart all depended on reliving the past over and over. But I couldn’t fool myself into thinking that. I had to accept that I needed to move on. I needed a good grip on reality without the help of anything else.
A napkin suddenly fell on my table. DJ started wiping the stains away. “There, like it’s brand new,” he said smiling. As he left, I looked at my spotless table. I took out a white, clean sheet of paper and clicked on my pen. I started to write.I still cannot believe that I have never made bonda before. In fact it has been many years since I ate bonda. When I chose this month’s theme for BM, I decided that I would only do non-Indian dish for the potato theme. When I was going back and forth deciding the dishes I would be making, the potato bonda kept pricking me. I just could not get past it before putting it down as a dish of choice. So here I am, happy and fulfilled after eating a plate full of delicious bondas.
Since the theme was potato dishes, I made the filling exclusively potato. You could make your choice of filling with any vegetable along with the potatoes. Potato makes it a hearty dish and is just so delightful. Next time I will be adding some carrots, peas and beans along with potatoes when making the bonda.
Preparation time – 15 minutes
Cooking time – 1 hour
Difficulty level – easy
Ingredients – Makes around 18 – 20 Bondas
For the filling –
- Potato – 4 medium
- Onion – 1 medium (finely chopped)
- Ginger – ½ inch piece
- Green chilies – 3
- Curry leaves – few
- Mustard seeds – 1 tsp
- Cumin seeds – ½ tsp
- Ullutham paruppu / Urad dal – 1 tsp
- Turmeric powder – ½ tsp
- Salt – to taste
- Oil – 1 tbsp plus more to deep fry
- Cilantro – to garnish
- Besan / chick pea flour / Kadalai maavu – ¾ cup
- Rice flour – ¼ cup
- Chili powder – ½ tsp
- Asafetida – a pinch
- Baking soda – ¼ tsp
- Salt – to taste
- Water – as needed to make the batter
To make the filling –
- Boil the potatoes. I usually do this in the microwave. Peel the skin and cut the potatoes into cubes. Sprinkle some water (about 3-4 tbsp) and cover with a food grade plastic wrap. Microwave for about 10 minutes or until the potatoes are very soft. Using a fork, mash the potatoes and keep it aside. Make sure that you do not add too much water when cooking the potatoes since it will cause the filling to be on the wet side and it will be difficult to shape the bondas.
- In a pan, heat 1 tbsp of oil and add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Once the seeds crackle, add the urad dal, asafetida, curry leaves, green chilies and ginger. Fry for about 30 seconds and then add the turmeric powder.
- Add the chopped onions and fry until translucent. Now add the mashed potatoes along with the salt and mix well. Cook on low flame for about 2-3 minutes until the mixture thickens and comes together. Now add the cilantro and mix one more time. Take it off the flame and let it cool down to room temperature.
- When the mixture cools down enough to handle, make small equal size balls out of them and place it on a plate.
- Mix all the ingredients mentioned for the covering (except water) in a medium bowl.
- Add water slowly to form a smooth thick batter. Make sure that the batter is on the thicker side.
- Heat the oil for deep frying in a deep bottom pan/kadai.
- Place about 4-5 shaped potato balls inside the filling mixture. Turn around to coat it well. Carefully lift the coated balls and slide it into the hot oil. Repeat the same with the rest of the potato balls placed inside the batter. Depending on the size of the kadai you can about 5 – 6 bondas at a time. Do not add any more than this as that would decrease the oil temperature.
- Fry the bondas in medium temperature until they are golden brown.
- Carefully remove them from oil and place it on a paper towel lined dish to drain the extra oil.
- Repeat the same with the rest of the potato balls.
- Serve hot with coconut chutney or hot sauce or ketchup!LIM.

Another 26 people, many of them patients in their beds, were killed when part of a hospital in Pisco collapsed, the DPA news agency reported. Fernando Barrios, the president of the hospital, appealed for the injured to be taken to Lima, because the remainder of the Pisco hospital was without water or electricity and was unable to treat them.
Andina, the state news agency, said that a special flight path had been established to ferry badly injured people from the hardest hit areas to Lima by air, to relieve overcrowding in local hospitals.
Mayor Juan Mendoza Uribe of Pisco said that 70 percent of the city of about 60,000 people, located 135 miles south of Lima, was leveled by the quake.
“So much effort and our city is destroyed,” he said, crying audibly, in comments broadcast on radio station RPP in Lima. The city remained without electricity this morning. Hundreds of families slept on the streets outside ruined houses, according to Andina, and 25 bodies were placed in front of municipal buildings after the morgue filled to capacity.
The president of Peru, Alan Garcia, arrived in Pisco around late in the morning to view the damage firsthand, the agency reported.
A wall collapsed at the Tambo de Mora prison in Chincha, another town hit hard by the earthquake, and about 680 prisoners escaped, according to Manuel Aguilar, vice president of the National Institute of Penitentiaries. About 29 were recaptured and transferred to another jail, he said.stop.”
Her belongings in the apartment went flying and the glass windows appeared to be bending in. “People really thought they were going to die,” Ms. Anderson said.
Peruvian officials said there had been a total of more than 320 aftershocks, the strongest reaching a magnitude of about 6.
Offers of aid quickly poured in from many countries, including Spain, France, Venezuela and Colombia. The state news agency said that Chile, which recalled its ambassador to Peru, Christian Barros, earlier in the week because of a dispute over maritime boundaries between the two countries, would send Mr. Barros back to Lima immediately to help coordinate rescue and aid efforts.
Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for President Bush, said in Texas this morning that the United States was ready to provide aid and assistance, and that a team from the Agency for International Development was in Lima assessing the situation and coordinating with the Peruvian government. American search and rescue teams were standing by to go to Peru if they are needed there, Mr. Johndroe said.
The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake struck about 90 miles southeast of Lima at a depth of about 25 miles. A tsunami warning was issued for coastal areas.Continue reading the main storyFruit:
Buy fresh fruit of your choice. Peel (and pit) peaches or apples and cut into segments/pieces. Put in a baking pan alone, or pour some 100% fruit juice in the bottom of the pan. Bake at 400.

This is my 2015 Halloween Costume. I really enjoyed this build because it allowed me to exercise my creative ability to its fullest. This costume took 2 months to build and several trial and errors. In the video and pictures submitted you will see a futuristic Time Traveling Prophesier(i.e.Fortune Teller). This costume incorporates Magic and illusion combined with electronic 3d Hologram Imagery.
The effect is a half body set on top of an old crate which has opened up like a “Jack in the Box” effect. The design of this crate looks as if it completely empty other than a tripod stand in the center. On lookers are able view this effect inches away at all angles, can shine lights inside and take flash photography without revealing it’s secret illusion. Placed on the top of this crate is an crystal pyramid displaying 3d hologram images that change every 10 sec with a smoke transition.
This Pyramid (crystal ball) can be viewed from each side as well viewing a moving object that appears to be suspended in its center. The backdrop (lid) of the crate contains large gears of various sizes, curtains, and flaming torches. Suspended above the box crate is a vintage black and white striped umbrella with small gears attached around its circumference. This umbrella also contains a light for assisted lighting of the costume.
This umbrella also rotates constantly in a circular motion like a Merry-go-Round of gears. The character is a Steam Punk Hat containing Goggles and gears and Mask containing gears and electronic components. The jacket worn is a Civil War Band jacket which I love so much I will be wearing it even after Halloween. I hope you enjoy.Well, it sure was a quick summer, if you can call it that! Just two weeks of hot weather was not enough for me. I really needed more swimming time and the vegetable garden was just too wet. I'm sure in a few years, when we need the rain, I'll think back on this summer.
quite rainy and I'll try hard not to complain but I can't help wondering if all of this precipation continues into winter; the cold, COLD winter, what will winter be like? :-)
Bill and I are enjoying our retirement to the max. I'm subbing where I want, when I want and am just thrilled to help out old friends, meet new ones and see "my" kids from yesteryear as they grow through the grades at the other schools.
We enjoy cooking and have showed off a bit: Bill with his Blueberry Grunt and me with my Apple Pie which took 3rd place at a contest.
At church I am volunteering a few times a week, sing in choir, am on the music committee and head up the Drama team. Once a week I get to play with our granddaughter, Isabella, which helps out her mommy as she bathes their show dogs, works on her painting and other things that need attention from grown up fingers, not little ones!
Bill is now on the board of dirctors at Sacandaga Bible Conference where he has been voluteering this past summer. He's working P/T with the Montgomery Co. Sherrif's Office, still and continues to help out at SBC.
We managed to sneak away at the beginning of fall ... to find the last vestiges of summer down in NJ, DE and MD.
Bill and Julie are busy at work in New Jersey, but come up very often to help out at Sacandaga Bible Conference as the cooks. Granddaughter, Erika and granddoggie, Dito sometimes come to spend the nights with us. This makes Grammy and Papa very happy!
We were able to purchase another 12 acres of land attached to ours which will give us a measure of privacy as the Avery's begin to sell off their Christmas Tree farm here in Meco. Bill has been clearing out some of the overgrowth in a few areas and we should have some nice little trees of our own. This clearing out has given us fuel for some bonfires in the back yard.

B2B or the business-to-business is the exchange of services, products, or communications among businesses as opposed to between businesses and consumers (B2C). Business-to-business communication mix is communications strategies employed to exchange information among companies, organizations or industries. As posited by Vitale and Giglierano (2002), B2B communication refers to the procedure of harmonizing and merging the abilities of the supplier with required results of the clients to create value for the "customer's customer" and, hence, create value for both organizations". Although early attention centred on the development of retailing on the Internet, estimates are that B2B returns will by far surpass business-to-consumers (B2C) returns in the future.
The point of Business-to-Business Communications is to ensure that the selling procedure is as cost efficient as feasible. B2B Integrated Communication Options includes Public Relations, Trade Journal Advertising, direct mail, Directories, Brochures & Sales Literature, Exhibitions, Trade Shows, Conventions, Sponsorship or Event Marketing, Media Advertising and Interactive (on-line) Advertising & Web Sites. B2B integrative communication mix involves the amalgamation and exploitation of a number of these forms of media by a company or its unit to communicate its message to create and maintain a client base and brand image.
In this analysis, the IBM use of social media to realize their B2B communications objectives will be examined. IBM centres their social media efforts on getting their workforce chatting outside the company's firewall to sharpen their skill.
The concept behind this is that the best way to represent the brand is to display its workforce and their expertise. A number of their social endeavours began within the firm as a method of enabling the staff members to learn from each other and work together. Eventually, some of these the in-house tools turned out to be products presented to the marketplace. IBM has a platform where employees upload videos and podcasts. The firm has done work on the outside by shifting the corporate pigeonholes of B2B video. This B2B interactive communication strategy has doubled visitors to the firm's website, and also won abundant press mentions.

Reflection on Christmas MorningBeing the bookworm that I am, I greatly enjoyed the dialogue revolving around renowned authors and novels. As Langella’s character remarks, it’s simply refreshing to encounter a young person (even a fictional one) who actually reads. Lauren Ambrose is absolutely charming as the bright and bold Heather, and I believe she may be the most beautiful and talented actress of my generation.
The film also contains a fascinating examination of the painful transition from enthusiast to critic, as well as the tempestuous relationship that exists between critics and artists. The brewing conflict finally comes to the fore during the pivotal scene in which Wolfe voices the unreasonable expectations we as fans often have for the work of our most beloved artists – be they authors, filmmakers, or musicians – and Schiller reacts with the righteous frustration of an artist whose creative freedom and evolving talent has been called into question by a demanding admirer.
The secondary plot involving Schiller’s daughter Ariel – played by Lili Taylor of I Shot Andy Warhol
and Say Anything
– and her rekindled romance with Casey (Adrian Lester of Primary Colors
and Love’s Labour’s Lost
) is at first merely a pleasant diversion, as the most mesmeric scenes are those of the two magnificent main characters. But as the central storyline moves painfully toward its conclusion, the dynamic between Ariel and Casey becomes much more compelling.
However, what I love most about this film is the sweet sexual tension that simmers between the brazen young Wolfe and hesitant, weary Schiller. The most sensual scenes possess the subtle artistry of classic films – such as the obvious effect that Wolfe’s innocent removal of her boots and subsequent revealing of her ankles has on the aging novelist. I hate to spoil the film for those who haven’t seen it yet, but I personally think that the tableau in which Schiller hovers his hand over Wolfe without actually touching her is one of the most erotic and emotional moments in cinematic history. Even the simple act of Schiller taking Heather’s hand and touching her hair is full of such graceful passion that the kiss that follows seems anti-climatic.
Yes! When I read the scene you describe on paper – as well as the two honey scenes – I thought this could be a GREAT movie (I was the production sound mixer on the film and read the screenplay before signing on).
Lauren is indeed one of the most talented living thespians as is Langella.
Together, controlled demolition.
Thanks for paying attention to smaller cinematic endeavors.
Great! Can’t wait to see it!
Faux Press – though I’ve been in contact with many of the artists whose albums I’ve reviewed, this is the first time somone involved in a film has read my review of it. Thanks for taking the time to comment. 🙂

It has never been a secret of my adoption. My parents thought it was best to be open, what if I had discovered the truth by accident. I live in a loving home with two parents who love me. I could have my birth records if I ask. I'm told my parents were Seniors in high school when I was born. My mother was 17 and her parents thought it was best to place me up for adoption. I feel this had to be a very hard choice to make with feelings of guilt always present. I could seek out and find my biological parents, I have several questions. Do I have any brothers and sisters? Do you ever wonder who I became? Whom do I get my physical features from? Tell them I have a wonderful life and the greatest parents ever. Thank you for giving me life. Yet I don't want to know at the same time. I know finding them can be either a pleasant or dramatic encounter. I have a friend who found his birth mother. She made it clear she wanted no further contact with him. I think it would hurt my parents some by going by seeking my biological parents. I would be placing my mom in second place to another woman. My mother is the only mother i truly have and always will have. I love mom and dad, I know that I'm there son and always will be. At this time I am content to leave this door closed.
I've just adopted two boys who were my foster children. We go to court on the 15th March to make it all legal and final. I've really enjoyed reading your story and to see what my boys may think whenthey grow older. It's sad, their story isn't as clean, I fostered them because of domestic violence and physical and sexual abuse so we do worry about what the future holds. I'm glad you had a good adoptive experience, I've read a lot of horror stories on here so it has been good to see something more positive. Thanks for sharing :o)
I admire all your achievements. Glad to have you as a friend. Why are most of my friends Aries ?
I think you meant "adoption," hon'. "Adaptation" is something else, entirely.
It's good to hear that you are happy with the parents who raised you and can appreciate the love they have for you. Some things are better left alone.
it sounds like your parents raised a fine son :)- Details

That is, they don’t cover real events happening to real people in the real world. They are actual blogs. They’re just fictional. They cover the events in lives of fictional characters in imaginary worlds that can (but often don’t) resemble the real world.
Since today, June 15, 2013, is Free Role Play Game Day, we thought we’d take a closer look at fictional blogging (disclaimer, the author maintains multiple fiction/character blogs and has written the ebook on TBRP).
There are two types of fiction blogs. The first and probably the most common type, belongs to a specific character. The second type follows a particular story or plot. Both a character or a story line blog can have a single author or be a collection of works from a variety of authors. In some cases, each character might have a sub-blog with the master, top level, blog being the collected stories of all the characters (this is a great way to write a novel for NaNoWriMo, by the way).
Many fictional blog posts are based on writing prompts and their format reflects that. Typically such posts stem from a prompt table of some kind, although this isn’t always true. Some just use the format which consists of some basic “front matter” including:
- Title
- Author (if the blog has multiple contributors or follows more than one character, otherwise the author is assumed to be the character who’s blog it is posted on)
- Prompt (if a prompt table or other source of inspiration like music or tarot cards is being used)
- Word Count
- Characters (characters depicted/involved in the post, directly or indirectly)
- Summary (a summary of the post, what storyline it belongs to, setting or time period, where it falls in character’s timeline, etc.)
- Warnings/Announcements (NSFW, adult themes and which ones, contains spoilers, etc.)
- Disclaimers (if the author does not own the rights to the characters or universe, who does?)
Once that business is taken care of, a fictional post is very similar to an excerpt from a novel or a short story. Some are parts of a larger work while others, sometimes referred to as one-offs, stand alone on their own. Some authors include photos or other images with their posts or may provide additional information to help readers understand the context of the post.
Fictional blogs can be some of the most creative and extensive blogs you’ll ever see. They can also be very bare bones and text-heavy. It depends on the blogger and the platform.
Tumblr hosts a number of fictional character blogs. The nature of Tumblr means these blogs are highly visual (lots of images) and the entries are relatively short and quick to read. Tumblr blogs can also include tweets, music and video which allows readers to get a more complete and complex sense of the characters. Some of our favorite Tumblogs are:
- Tales of Murhder – An Alternate Universe (AU) blog based on the characters from the Black Dagger Brotherhood novel series.
- Bubblegum Vamp – An Original Character (OC) blog set in an alternate True Blood universe.
- The Werewolf Within – An AU blog based on the character from the Southern Vampire Mysteries.
- Love Cannot Die – Some of the best paranormal steampunk fiction around.
If Tumblr offers a better sense of character because of it’s social network flavor, WordPress boasts some truly remarkable and complex fiction that often reads like a novel or even a series of novels. Among the truly remarkable fiction you’ll find on WordPress.com are:
- Musings of a Madman – Is a frighteningly fascinating alternate Hannibal universe that is home to some intriguing original characters.
- Diaries of a Dead Girl – An AU blog based on the True Blood/Southern Vampire Mysteries universe.
- Remaije – A Neverwinter blog
- The Haunted World of Shades – Some hauntingly good ghost stories!
It’s worth noting that none of these are my characters or blogs although my characters have made appearances or been reblogged on some them. Also, you’ve no doubt noticed the True Blood/Southern Vampire Mysteries trend. This is because that is the fanfiction world I am most familiar with. If you’re really curious, you can find fiction that has flowed from my pen at: Reflections of the Night on WordPress as well as several places around Tumblr like Pam’s Place and Dark Attitude, which are all Southern Vampire Mystery blogs. (I do blog other original fiction, however, I’m hoping to turn them into books/novels so I’m not going public with them.)
The practice of fiction blogging is not too different from nonfiction blogging. The art of it is a different matter.

Community Forum Software by IP.BoardHeute möchte ich euch einen Holzpiraten vorstellen, der an einem weit entfernten Ort restauriert wird: Long Island, USA (genauer: hier bei LISEC). Der Kontakt ist bislang leider nur sporadisch, daher konnte ich noch nicht viel über dieses Boot in Erfahrung bringen. Auch ist im Moment nicht klar wann und wie das Boot über den Teich gelangte. Es ist ein VEB Bau soviel ist sicher, aber vieles andere ist unklar und ich hoffe noch mehr zu erfahren. Bis dahin erfreue ich mich über diese ersten Bilder.
Ich zitiere ein wenig aus den Mails von Robert:
Malte,
your page is very helpful. I can’t express my gratitude to all the information you are providing. We continue to work on the Pirate. We’ve removed all of the hull planking as they were too rotten to repair. We have reinforced the keel with epoxy to make it stronger. We now are beginning with replacing the ribs. We are swapping out the oak for a mahogany for ease of use. In the process an issue was observed. On the hull planking that is adjacent to the chine, where the water line is, the hull plank bows out slightly and is not flush. It is actually wavey in parts. The condition is only observable when we place a ruler along the plane but it is an item that has us concerned whether these entire planks need to be replaced. The alternative is to soak or heat the wood an hope that they return to flush.
Have you encountered this or know of someone involved with your festival? I’ll take some photos so you can visualize the issue we are facing.Thanks for your help – as always,Rob
Hey Malte,Thanks for saying hello. The Pirate is coming along. Most important, she has earned a name: St. Gallen.Attached are a bunch of updated pictures, which i took this morning while at the shop. She has new ribs made of Mahogany. We’ve reinforced the sisters with oak. Rebuilt the centerboard trunk with the old wood and some new oak. Bronze hardware. New Mahogany transom. Original floor board supports. We are working on replacing a part of the keel at the stem and knee. New battens (2/4 cut and fit) all made from Mahogany. There has been loads of sanding.We should be ordering the hull wood and wood for the soars in the next 6-8 weeks. I’ll send you more pics as we continue to progress.
The tiller is combination of Mahogany and American walnut that was laminated together. We are using a walnut cross support. It is coming out wonderful and will be ready for varnish in the next week or so.We have completed the new knee and just ordered the hull materials and spar materials. We ordered a 5 mm thick okume which we will lay two layers for the hull and also got two beautiful pieces of Sitka spruce for the spars. All will be delivered Tuesday. All for Battens have been installed with the attachment of the last two battens to the knee being one of the last steps before the hull gets added.
Seid ihr auch gespannt wie es weiter geht? Ich hoffe Robert meldet sich bald wieder.In the Epic of Gilgamesh called Enkidu's Dream written around 2000 BC, the bleak concept of death being an express outcome of sins committed in life, there is a very apt reference to kings' "crowns put away forever" and the ones who stood at any worldly position on Earth "stood now like servants". This depicts how the Mesopotamian had an acute belief that the afterlife was merely suffering and distress to say the least and the dead were both pitied and feared.
Furthermore, the references to "vampire foot", "lion's foot" and "eagle's talon" all illustrate the fears that the people of this time had and how they associates all that they feared with the dismal possibility of death and what they figured would happen afterwards.
Contrary to this dreary outlook to life after death of the Mesopotamian people, the Greeks were more optimistic about the afterlife. Although they believed that the people who did wrong on Earth will be punished severely by the gods in the afterlife, they also believed that the good doers will have an eternally peaceful life; modern researchers believe that the concept of heaven and hell originated from this era.
The Myth of ER which is the concluding part of Plato's dialogue called The Republic, talks of a man called ER who dies in battle but remains un-decomposed even after ten days when his body was recovered. Waking up two days later on his unreal pyre, he tells his people about his passage to the afterlife (probably one of the first recounts of out of body experiences) in which he sees that moral people were rewarded and the immoral were castigated in their afterlives.
Many believe that this was the point where the belief that the soul was mere energy and never dies came about and the intervention of a divine being brought about conviction in following religions. Punishment and rewards in the afterlife were considered a direct consequence of one's conduct in life.
The Egyptians were another matter altogether. While both the Greeks and Mesopotamians agreed on the fact that there was a life after death which may either be absolutely bleak or have either a reward or a punishment awaiting them, the Egyptians treated their dead as if they were not dead after all. Elaborate preparations went into the ensuring that a person's ka (soul) and ba (personality) were united and the being would once more surface to travel to the heavens - intact and whole. The body was embalmed for preservation and provisions like writing paper, wigs, clothing and even tools were made available that the dead may need in the afterlife.
The pyramid texts inscribed inside the pyramids of some pharaohs of the fifth and the sixth dynasties are primarily associated with the transition of the dead pharaoh to its heavenly abode. "He is not of the earth, he is of the sky. . . ." depicts this transition in terms of the passage a dead being takes after the incorporation of the ka and the ba. Journey to the next world is imminent and the work continued as if alive!
While both the Mesopotamians and the Greek eloquently believed that death is the end and the after life depicts what we have done in actual life, the Egyptians believed in the re-usage of energy (soul) for the continuation of the same work being done at the time of death. Oddly enough,

...a jet black bird with a bright red spot on it, landing just inside the mangrove trees.
On our first morning in the Florida Keys, we all found ourselves looking at everything with an extra helping of excitement and patience.
In the middle of our collective ohs and ahs, a shaggy- haired, unimpressed pre- teen deadpans, "It's just a blackbird."
Even in paradise, there's always one party pooper.
His cynicism drizzled big, fat cold drops on our happy parade.
His demeanor reeked of the very entitlement I secretly fear I might be instilling in my own children.
His lack of emotion view stood in stark contrast to the nostalgia and importance I seem to be attaching to seemingly inconsequential moments as I fight against an increasing sense of middle age angst.
It might just be a blackbird-- a red- winged blackbird to be exact-- but, at my age, I know there are many ways to look at a blackbird.
Just ask Wallace Stevens.
If we weren't on a dock, Mr. Pre- Teen, if we were in my classroom, I would be delighted to introduce you to one of my favorite poems, "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird."
Alas, I can only hope that one day you will see the joy in the ordinary-- even when you are surrounded by the extraordinary.
Until then, thank you, Mr. Too Cool for the Birds, for being my muse and inspiring me to write again after too many months away from MaMe Musings.
Today, on our last day of the most fantastic vacation of my life to the Florida Keys, here's my poor attempt at imitation of one of the great modern American poets.
I.
Among the Florida Keys,
the main thing we noticed--
the stunning beauty of the water, the sky, and
the antics of Emily and Andrew.
II.
I was amused,
Like a mom who just heard her 6 year old say,
"I'm eyeballing you."
III.
Emily giggled, in the backseat, on the beach.
A small thing but more sparkling than the green water beneath Seven Mile Bridge.
IV.
Emily and Andrew
are hilarious.
Their conversation on the back of the golf cart in Key West,
More golden than the sunset at Mallory Square.
V.
I do not know which I prefer--
Andrew rambling on about catching a 12 inch yellowtail snapper or
Emily performing a show on the hammock-- for the 12th time.
VI.
Tears filled the peaceful afternoon
as Emily danced her way to a skinned knee and elbow
on the old Bahia Honda Rail Bridge.
VII.
Oh, pesky noseeums of the Keys,
Why do you bite us so?
Do you not how much fun we are having
Digging in the sand, wading in the water, and reading my first book in a year?
VIII.
I know the excitement
of seeing my two children up on paddleboards,
bravely and confidently paddling through the same water
I fell into.
IX.
When the people at the buffet
Left their trash behind,
Emily cleans it up, saying,
"Since they don't even know where the trash can is."
X.
At the turtle hospital,
Questions abound.
We feel in love with Smelly Cat and Chuck Norris.
And bless the hearts of the poor bubble butts.
XI.
We rode over the Seven Mile Bridge.
My toes out the window.
More than once, a desire to sell it all and move here
Consumed me.
XII.
The tide is moving out.
We paddle the kayaks harder.
XIII.
It was the 300 sand balls Andrew made on the beach.
It was watching them make friends on the beach.
It was the smell of charcoal on the beach.
It was the feel the dorsal of the dolphin.
It was our blackbird.

Is Apple Purposefully Slowing Down Old iPhones? Degraded Batteries Controversy
A Reddit post went viral a couple days ago, in which an iPhone 6s user reported that replacing his battery drastically increased the phone’s performance, with iOS 11.
The discussion lead to theories and speculation that Apple purposefully slows down older iPhones to “full day’s charge if the battery has degraded over time,” according to Mac Rumors.
According to the Reddit user TeckFire, their iPhone had been trudging through its function at a slow pace after its update to iOS 11, particularly compared to their brother’s iPhone 6 Plus, so their research led them to the idea that they should replace the battery.
.” – Reddit user
This isn’t the first time Apple has been accused of purposefully slowing down old models of their iPhones. Although this accusation is less heavy, little explanation is offered to people whose iPhones behave strangely after the release of a new model each time.
This is a topic that requires firsthand experience: if you observe a phone suddenly become different, is it a coincidence?

The Magna Carta is a prized charter, written by the Archbishop of Canterbury to strike a peace deal between a king who wasn’t well-liked and barons who were rebellious. Upon inquisition, the charter reveals that it promised to uphold church rights, safeguarding barons from being imprisoned illegally, provide accessible roadways to justice and the setting of a cap on feudal payments to the Crown. Made possible because of twenty-five barons initially, the document was later cast aside by both parties because they found it tough to keep their promises.
AdvertisementsAnd so, a few months into the year, August Witt is writing notes on organic molecules and electron bindings on the board in his 3.091 lecture. The students in the front of the lecture hall are diligently taking notes, the students in the middle of the hall are just as diligently passing notes, and the students in the back of the hall are napping after the weekend's parties, when suddenly the door bursts open, and a figure runs in. He's dressed all in black, wearing a black fencing mask and carrying a saber, and he calls out "August Witt! For too many years you have bored the freshmen with your talk of molecules and elements, and I have come to put a stop to it! Defend yourself!" And he runs down to the front of the lecture hall.
Before Witt has a chance to reply, a door bursts open at the other side of the lecture hall, and a figure all in white runs in, wearing a white fencing mask and carrying a saber, and says "August Witt! For years you have been teaching the freshmen well! I will defend your honor!"
Now, at this point, there is a departure from the script, because Witt steps forward, takes the saber from the figure in white, and says "Thank you, but I will defend my own honor." And then he enters fencing stance, and proceeds to chase the swordsman in black all the way across the classroom and disarm him.
You see, what the freshmen failed to realize when planning their hack is that before he came to MIT, August Witt had been the three-time National Fencing Champion of Austria. The moral of the story? Make sure you always know just who you're hacking.

Dermatology is an all-encompassing field of medicine including treatment and maintenance of the skin, hair, and nails. In an effort to honor the “toe” portion of our promise to provide “head to toe skin care”, Dermatology Associates of Atlanta would like to warn you about a recent development surrounding the popular Ugg® boots, and how they could be contributing to foot fungus. People buy Uggs® because they are warm and cozy, but wearing them all the time, especially without socks, may compromise health in the long run.
Many Ugg® wearers habitually forego wearing socks. The wool lining is nice and warm without socks, right? While they may seem warm enough, foot fungus is more prevalent without socks because the boot’s wool interior and thick suede exterior will make feet sweat. Without socks to help wick the sweat, the wool absorbs and holds the moisture (providing the perfect environment for fungus formation and bacteria growth). Without a barrier to protect the wearer’s foot, they are then exposed to the bacteria and possible funguses in the shoe’s interior with every subsequent use.
The most common type of foot fungus is athlete’s feet, which is caused by a fungus called Trichophyton. Some other skin conditions of the feet may include: contact dermatitis, allergic reaction, eczema, psoriasis, yeast infections, toenail fungus, or bacterial infections. As previously stated, the fungus and bacteria that cause these conditions usually grow in warm, dark, and moist places. Because these conditions are easy to create, socks are a worthwhile investment.
DAA does not blame the makers of Uggs® for their comfortable boots causing foot fungus. In fact, the skin conditions mentioned above can happen in any shoe if feet are not properly protected. Our dermatologists suggest always wearing socks, and not wearing footwear that doesn’t allow feet to breathe for long periods of time. If you’ve been experiencing foot conditions such as redness, rash, scaling, itching, cracked skin, or thick and discolored toenails it’s a good idea to seek medical attention to determine the proper treatment method.

For little more than the cost of an internet connection I can spend endless hours being amused. This 2008 campaign may be the most entertaining yet. While I rarely use this blog to discuss politics (and especially when I’m as ignorant of a topic as I am with U.S. politics), today I’ll make the rare exception. Over the past few days I’ve bookmarked a whole lot of links and today will try to tie a few of them together.
Sarah Palin is undoubtedly the most electrifying and polarizing figure we’ve seen in U.S. politics for a long, long time. She has completely changed the face of election. A week ago the media could not break away from Barack Obama. Today Sarah Palin is dominating the discussion. She was the perfect foil; if anyone doubts McCain’s smarts, I’d say he has proven himself the wily veteran with this pick. This has become an Obama vs. Palin election. At least for now, McCain is taking a back seat in his own Presidential election campaign. It’s all about Sarah. Chuck Colson’s article on clashing worldviews is interesting reading. “In the life of Sarah Palin, we see the clash of worldviews playing out before our own eyes. Consider every major controversial issue in American politics and culture right now . . . and somehow, they touch her personally.” Everyone can either love or hate Palin; few are ambivalent.
It’s little wonder that many evangelicals are quickly learning to love her. The little boy Piper Palin spit-shined in front of the nation is living, breathing proof of Palin’s commitment to life–probably the single most important issue to a vast number of Christians. In an age when 90 or 95 out of every 100 children with Down Syndrome are destroyed, Trig is, well, alive. That, in and of itself, is almost miraculous today. Asked about her brother’s Syndrome, Palin’s daughter Willow said, “I don’t care – he’s my brother and I love him.” Trig is exactly who God made him to be and he is a gift to that family.
But the greatest source of Palin’s appeal must be her sheer normalcy. She is exactly the kind of pit bull hockey mom you’d meet anywhere in Alaska (or Canada). She’s so unlike the majority of the politicians who strive for the White House. It seems almost a mistake that she is up on that platform.
People on the Loony Left know they hate Palin but they are struggling with how to hate her. They turned first on her children, insisting that her infant son could not possibly be her own. They smeared her for having a baby in her “old age” (as if they all had their families in their prime child-bearing years) and determined that the baby must be her daughters’. The stupendous stupidity of leveling and believing such a charge showed just how far people would stoop to attempt to discredit her. Of course the controversy was quickly resolved when the McCain campaign announced that Palin’s daughter was pregnant with a child of her own. Perhaps worst of all, she was going to keep the baby and will marry the father. While I read many articles assuring the American public that Palin was lying about being the mother of Trig, I don’t recall reading nearly so many retractions or apologies.
Things got even weirder than this. Liberal feminists (is that redundant?) began to turn on Palin. You would think women would be thrilled to see a woman who is poised to rise higher in government than any woman before her, but this was not the case. While these feminists would have cheered Hillary Clinton as President or Vice President, Palin was not exactly the woman they had in mind. Not the hockey mom, church-going mother of five who is undoubtedly a better shot than Dick Cheney! And not the woman who is a powerful figure while remaining feminine and attractive. Stand to Reason says … Gov. Palin seems to have a feminine appeal while displaying her capability and strength.”
And so feminists wondered if she could possibly take care of her family while dealing with her responsibilities as Vice President. The feminists said this! Eventually there was something of a backlash and prominent feminists were forced to speak out. But the damage had already been done–we had seen another example of how far the left is willing to go to discredit this McCain/Palin ticket. They’ll gladly violate their own principles to keep McCain out of the White House. It truly was a shameful week for the press.
Interestingly, while feminists have been asking whether Palin can care for her nation and her family, Christians have been wondering the same. Is it right for a woman to take on a position of such responsibility? Is it right for her to assume a position of leadership? No sooner had Palin been announced than Voddie Baucham wrote a much-publicized article in which he said this: “My point is simple. The job of a wife and mother is to be a wife and mother. Anything in addition to that must also be subservient to it. There is no higher calling. Moreover, I believe Paul’s admonition [in Titus 2] should lead us to reject any notion of a wife and mother taking on the level of responsibility that Mrs. Palin is seeking.” Baucham believes that the pro-life party is using Palin as a pawn in a move that is distinctly anti-family. Those who know of Baucham will know that he is very conservative when it comes to the role of women (going so far in The Return of the Daughters to suggest that women should probably not go to college).
Other more moderate conservative Christians spoke up. Writing for the Council for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, David Kotter asked, “Does Sarah Palin Present a Dilemma for Complementarians?” He answered very well, saying, .” Al Mohler agrees, saying .”
One blog I appreciated was Amy’s (which has 173 comments and counting). Amy takes issue with the automatic assumption that a woman’s highest calling is to be a wife and mother. “Being a wife and mother is a good and noble thing, but it is not the highest thing.”
And I firmly agree with Amy and Mohler and Kotter. While Christians do want to maintain the focus on the family we have to be careful about stating categorically that a woman has no business running for Vice President. Palin’s decision is one to be made with her family and with counsel from her local church. Beyond that we, as Christians, have to trust her judgment in this kind of disputable matter. Far be it from us to declare that she cannot do both and that she cannot do both with excellence.
The timing of this campaign is interesting since we are likely to be facing an election here in Canada in the weeks to come. Palin is an unique figure and for so many reasons. Her husband is a snowmobile racer, for goodness sake. I wouldn’t be surprised if she gets a few write-in votes in our election.“Story is the breath of human connection.”

Films – Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Suspense, Thriller, Superhero, Action Adventure – they all have one main thing in common (hopefully), and that is “story.” This list is more than favorites, it’s really many cherished stories with themes of courage, sacrifice, inspiration, mentors, family, responsibility, heroes, Father/Son, Male/Female, and self-discovery.
When I read a Blog Post with the same type of list from OnTheScreenReviews, I knew I would be doing a list soon. Here is my list of favorite films, from A to Z, and starting with a film whose name begins with a number
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
# – 12 Angry Men (1957)
Great cast. Great film. A lesson in doing the right thing, this courtroom drama, or rather Jury Room story presents the idea in the U.S. court system that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty. Still considered a classic, first-rate film.
A –.
B – The Bourne Identity (2002)
The Bourne films with Matt Damon are the best Action films of the last 15 years. It’s hard to pick, but for me the first in the series just beats the others as my favorite.
C – Casablanca (1942)
Although my favorite Humphrey Bogart film is actually The Big Sleep, what’s not to like about the movie that often tops the best of all time lists. Funny, I watched When Harry Met Sally several times, with it’s references to Casablanca, before I finally saw, and loved it. Thus, my favorite film that begins with a “C” is Casablanca.
D – Die Hard (1988)
As is most often the case, the first in a series is the movie I like the most. Bruce Willis, perfect as off-duty detective John McClane, and Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, he’s one of my favorite bad guys.
E – Ed Wood (1994)
I really like Tim Burton and his off beat view of things as presented in his films. And when you put him together with Johnny Depp you get something as oddly different and wonderful as this film. Not to mention the well deserved Academy Award winning performance of Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi.
F – Fiddler on the Roof (1971)
I amaze myself. A musical on my Favorites list. But I was hooked from the opening song “Tradition.” I so admire Tevye, his resilience, devotion to family, faith in God, and remarkable sense of humor, as he struggles to adapt to change. He’s always been like a father figure to me.
G –.
H – His Girl Friday (1940)
In this great romantic comedy Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell share some of the best movie dialogue ever and deliver every line with delicious precision. Cary Grant, one of my favorites, at his best.
I –.
J –.
K – Kubo and the Two Strings (2016)
A great story, wonderful soundtrack, and just a visually stunning stop-motion animated film. One of the very best non-Disney/Pixar animated movies ever made. It was a close choice as I do really like Kill Bill: Vol. 1 & 2 (2003-2004), the original King Kong (1933), and a first-rate foreign film, Kung Fu Hustle (2004). Still, Kubo slips ahead of the others for my letter “K” spot..”
M – The Matrix (1999)
Keanu Reeves is great as Neo in this visually stunning Sci-Fi Action film. The film that had a big impact on many films to follow, especially it’s very cool “bullet time” visual effect.
N – North by Northwest (1959)
Alfred Hitchcock, whose more than 50 films are as a whole arguably matchless for an overall body of work. In this classic thriller, Cary Grant’s character is mistaken for a spy. So many iconic scenes. Simply wonderful.
O – October Sky (1999)
A movie of hopes and dreams, a father and son relationship (that’s a choice theme for me), and . . . it’s got rockets! What more could you ask for.
P – The Princess Bride (1987)
Bridging the gap between generations, a grandfather shares a story with his reluctant grandson. It’s a fable packed with adventure, courage, friendship, romance and a whole lot of laughter.
Q – Quantum of Solace (2008)
A terrific James Bond movie. I almost feel guilty for liking Daniel Craig so much when Sean Connery has always been my favorite Bond.
R –).
S –.
T – Toy Story 1 & 2 (1995 & 1999)
Forgetting that they’re animated, these are two amazing films. I’m unable to rate one above the other. Giving life and personality to toys – pure fantasy that makes me believe it’s actually true.
U – Unbreakable (2000)
The Sixth Sense is a great movie but I love M. Night Shyamalan’s Unbreakable more. An awesome story of a superhero unaware of his power and dealing with his family. A sequel could be great.
V – Vertigo (1958)
Another Alfred Hitchcock film, again with Jimmy Stewart. All Hitchcock’s protagonists are flawed yet likeable characters. They are people we can identify with. Kim Novak, another of Hitchcock’s “blondes” is excellent as Madeleine, and Jimmy Stewart is amazing as Scottie Ferguson who’s obsessed with her.
W – When Harry Met Sally (1989)
Easily my favorite Romantic Comedy. The insights into male/female relationships continue to ring true and are delivered with such comic delight.
X – The X-Files (1998)
The movie captures the heart of the TV series, a groundbreaking Sci-fi drama. Agents Mulder and Scully involved in a larger scale version of a TV episode, that I felt was pulled off with great style .
Y – You’ve Got Mail .
Z – Zelig (1983)
Woody Allen is another director with a bountiful body of work, although unlike Alfred Hitchcock, Allen is hit and miss. But when he’s on the mark, which many of his films are, he can come up with a creative and hugely entertaining film, like Zelig. Nearly all his films he writes, directs, and even stars in. This “mockumentary” is almost believeable, and so much fun.
~ ~
My hobby’s are reading books and watching movies. I just love stories. I learn a lot about other people, and about myself through stories, fiction and non-fiction.
There are so many wonderful films out there, but it wasn’t too hard for me to make up the list. I’ve made lists of “Favorite Movies” before. One letter I found interesting was “S.” I realized I have a whole lot of films that I really, really like that begin with that letter. Some of those that fell just short of taking their place on the list include; Saving Private Ryan (1998), Shawn of the Dead (2004), Seven Samurai (1954), Secondhand Lions (2003), Sense and Sensibility (1995), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), and The Sixth Sense (1999).
The quote at the top of the post:
“Story is the breath of human connection.”
I love that quote.
And I love the person whom I am quoting.
It happens to be my daughter, Stephanie. Being a parent, and especially having her in my life has taught me so many things. Shes grown now and married.
I’ve always loved films, but it was my daughter Stephanie, who has taught me a lot about story. As an only child she has always loved reading, and she inspired me to become an avid reader. And discussions with her have contributed to my understanding of how important story has been for me in my life.
Thank you Stephanie. I love you!

Good choices.
Thank you, Jerry.
Love so many of the same ones. The ones I haven’t seen should soon get added to my Netflix cue. 😊
Thanks, Irene. I’ve been a big movie fan since I was a kid. It’s been a joy to try and see many great movies made between 1930 to 1960, so my favorites cover a wide range through more recent releases.
North by Northwest is in my personal top five. Fun Fact (for me at least) for The Princess Bridge (near the top of my list, too): Inigo Montoya is played by Mandy Patinkin who is now with Homeland (after his stint on Criminal Minds).
Yes, North by Northwest is so good. Actors and directors of favorite movies help me discover other work of their’s that I may have otherwise never seen.
unless one lives in a place like NYC where one can see retrospectives of directors and such, it becomes difficult to find those gems from the past…i also like to read interviews with actors and directors that explores their influences.
My list wouldn’t be identical, but there would be a LOT of overlap! Great list.
Thanks so much, Mitch. – p.s. – I hope to catch your film when it’s shown at the Burbank film festival.

Breeze Releases New #ZuluBaseKing EP. Listen & Download
Durban in general has been on a steady incline as far as hip hop is concerned. Between Dreamteam, Sketchy Bongo, Gemini Major, Aewon Wolf, SMB and a bunch of others, it’s looking like an industry coup d’etat.
Today, the self proclaimed Stage God, Breeze, takes the city one step closer to domination with the release of his EP #ZuluBaseKing. Breeze has been on his hustle for a minute, rocking performances at Good Sundaes and Head Honcho’s Stay Fresh all around the country, and serving heat in the form of music features and his won internet hits, ‘Amanga’ and ‘Ziyasha‘.
The EP keeps it close to home and tidy with the features, only extending the branch to Smashish, Aewon Wolf, WTF and Teabg; and the production, though not detailed on the tracklist, follows suit with traces of the thumping electronic bass fusion that we have become accustomed to from the likes of producers Muzi and Sketchy Bongo.
The best part? The 8-track tape is available for free download and you can also listen to it below. Don’t ever say HYPE ain’t put you on.
This is a quick and easy recipe I threw together last week with some ingredients I had laying around. I modified the original recipe at Epicurious, eliminating certain non-Paleo items and was quite happy with the outcome. It’s a little on the spicy side, but it’s pretty easy to adjust it for your own palate.
Ingredients
Instructions
To lower the spice level, you can swap the ancho and chipotle for 1 tbsp of sweet paprika. To increase the spice, swap out the chipotle for cayenne.
Edit: Because I usually appreciate a recipe with a picture, here is what the final product looks like from a batch I made last night.
This is a slight variation, as I used stew meat and didn’t have any carrots. I also added in 1/2 cup dried apricots and after step 5, threw everything into the crockpot for at least 6 hrs (I left it overnight).
Deadlift 1×5
3 Rounds:
10 Overhead Squats

@Pooj – I’m sure chicken would work quite well.
As far as a vegetarian option, I don’t know what to tell you. W30 approved vegetarian options are few and far between and I wrote this to adhere to a Paleo/W30 plan.
You could probably make this with cauliflower and it would turn out quite well as a side dish. I would still recommend you add a substantial protein such as egg or dairy, as your personal restrictions may allow.

On this December day, the family room is strewn with musical-minded clutter. Three guitars sit on stands. Brennen's mandolin rests beneath her T-shirt's logo for the Gibson Café in Nashville. In a rare moment, the unlikely cowgirl's bare feet are missing their rumpled tan cowboy boots. On the floor lies a timeworn, four-string banjo, played by their grandfather during country's heyday. Photos lie on the coffee table: An infant Seth sleeping in a guitar case owned by his father, Don, the athletic director at Moorhead High. Brennen and Seth playing at a fair.
"It all started really with our dad's old records, really Asleep at the Wheel, Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson," says Seth, an aerospace student at the University of North Dakota. "Dad wouldn't admit it, but he plays decent guitar, and I remember him playing bluegrass and country from the time we were very little."
At 13, Seth started plinking around on the guitar, learning tunes like "Froggy Went a' Courtin." But the early '90s grunge scene caught hold of the teen stronger than patchouli stench.
In a classic example of tomato, tomahto, Seth's electric guitar writhed with Nirvana and Led Zeppelin riffs in his buddy's garage, much to the police's chagrin. Meanwhile, Brennen sat alone in her room, singing and picking acoustically along with The Cranberries and Jewel. She began to play in local swing and progressive rock bands.
Those kind of artistic differences would never lead to Osmond family musical bliss. Their one true connection country western music had become a joke to both of them.
"We just got turned off to it; looking at the country scene back then, Billy Ray Cyrus break dancing in white tennis shoes on CMT, I mean, come on," Brennen says. "Of course we thought we hated country music, because we only heard the junk the music industry was telling us was country music."
The siblings eventually found some common ground with blues and old rock, helping to form short-lived cover group The Edgar Stevens Band. They played some rough numbers, including opening for the now disbanded Mr. Vanderbilt at 309 Broadway, where two of three customers were a man dancing with a sedated woman in a wheelchair.
"I was just 15, and that's a bit tough on the ego," Brennen says. "But you just gotta laugh. I figure, if one old guy is watching us, digging our music, it's worth it."
California cowboy Dwight Yoakam gets credit for Seth and Brennen's return to the old school.
"Two years ago, we went to see Dwight at the fair: It was probably the best day in my life to date," Brennen says. "I mean, I started to warm up to old style country before then, but when I saw Dwight, I was like, whoa. And that's about all I've wanted to listen to since then."
Since Seth had started school in Nashville, he also had been bit by the bluegrass bug. They began performing as a duo.
"Making that jump from despising country to that's what you like and perform, it's been really neat to watch," says father Don. "They like to credit me with things, but everything they've done has been because of their hard work and enthusiasm and responsibility. My wife and I have just sat back and enjoyed the music."
A regular act at places like The Trentino, 25th Street Market and the Cork n' Cleaver, growing audiences come out to hear Brennen Leigh play Hank Williams tunes like it's 1949 and they're fresh out of Tennessee.
Their lineup also regularly sweeps through Mississippi Delta blues, Texas swing, Appalachian mountain songs and Irish drinking songs. "We're Irish, so we feel at home doing those songs," Seth says. "Plus, Celtic and country music have a lot in common," Brennen adds. "One: alcoholism. Two: getting your heart broken. Three: the Lord. The instrumentation is also similar, lots of mandolin, banjo, violins, and there's always those happy little melodies."
A common shortcoming in fledgling groups, Seth admits Brennen Leigh lacks original material. They now perform just five to 10 originals at shows, mainly country laments like "Jessie James" and honky-tonk tunes like "No Way, Jose," which Brennen wrote after getting hit on in a San Antonio bar.
Despite that, the duo's opportunities and accolades are becoming more frequent.
"The music isn't the kind of thing you would think most people would enjoy, but they do it so well, people love it," says Peter Roufs, Trentino owner. "And they are truly as pleasant as they are talented; it's like Donny and Marie Osmond all over again."
The twosome has been asked to perform in the annual Celebration of Women and Their Music show at the Fargo Theatre in February. A solo Brennen recently sang a snippet of "Tonight, the Heartache's on Me," to win a singing contest at the Wild Horse Saloon in Nashville.
Ironically, Brennen says she has difficulties in her high school a capella choir and dreads music class graduation standards, which include a report and performance. "I asked my teacher if I could do a bluegrass piece, and it turns out the state Legislature mandates that bluegrass has a difficulty level of zero, so I can't," Brennen says. "How insulting."
This year presents the proverbial fork for the siblings. Brennen has decided to apply to Belmont University in Nashville, alma mater of country stars like Brad Paisley and Lee Ann Womack. All hinges on a performance audition at the end of this month.
The siblings are committed to performing together, but Seth waffles about whether that will be here or in Nashville after he graduates next year.
"Most guys (in Nashville) playing in the street for tips could smoke me," he says. "I'd have to do it for the pure love of music. Call me in 10 years and I will probably still be working at some waffle house," he laughs.
"But really, I might wait awhile to pursue the flying thing. I guess the only thing I don't want to do is look back and say 'You know, Brennen, we could have done so much more with our music.'"

Menu for Madiba M.Whilst a selected few intensive care nurses live it up in Marbella this weekend, grunts like me get the bum deal with shifts to cover the unit. I worked night shift last night and am due back for a twelve hour shift tomorrow daytime .
Hope my colleagues are enjoying their pina coladas!
Hope my colleagues are enjoying their pina coladas!
See ya round!
C'mon John. You would not have gone to Marbella regardless. The sad arse martyr wins all.
I wish you a boring shift with docile patients and whatever reasons for this and that, maybe you and no one else is meant to be there at this time.
Not to mention They will owe you big time for doing this.
That sucks. I'm sorry. Why didn't you get to go?
I guess the saying . . .
"someone has to do it!"
has your name on it . . .
(and where and when will you go for your holiday!)
Thank you for being there to cover. May you have patients that give you blog-fodder
Chin up and take your vitamins!
I thought you meant a real break X
Like Rachel, I thought you meant a voluntary break from blogging for a while. I have been pondering such a break myself. At least if I do so, it won't be due to twelve-hour shifts doing real work!
You got the raw end of that deal.......but think of all the stories you can tell!
Poor you. Try to keep the memory of your jaunts earlier in the year uppermost in your mind - that should carry you through.
You know you wouldn't have enjoyed Marbella.
They probably don't have scotch eggs in Marbella so you're not missing anything.
Hope work goes smoothly
Make sure there are a few scotched eggs in the fridge and some sort of sweet to pick you up.
Along with a good sleepy cuddle with the critters.
cheers, parsnip and thehamish
I've got some shifts going John if you want some more extra duties lol
All that sun would ruin your pale Welsh skin ;-)
You never know, they might have dreadful hangovers, dreadful weather and their luggage hasn't arrived yet.
I suppose it wouldn't be ethical to tell us a few tales from the ICU night shift?
I hope they bring you back some treats...
may you have quiet shifts.
I didnt
I'd wish something awful like shingles on them, but then you'd have to pull more shifts.
Cheer up John, they probably all went down with Montezuma's Revenge on the first night !We often don’t know if what we do makes any difference at all…..and then one day, when the neighbor girl is over climbing up the slide, we get our affirmation.
One of my problems in life, and I use the term problem loosely to not – at – all, is that I love to do a lot of things. I think life is too short, and we’re not guaranteed any set amount of minutes we get to plan, and so I often say no to nothing that I think is going to positively impact our lives. I say, yes, a lot. I am certain that I could be a better __________ (fill in the blank) if I would commit more to any one thing, but I just can’t see the point. I think in a lot of ways I’m pretty lucky to have the opportunities that I do, and I think opportunities come because I do say yes. I may not be able to quote too many movies or follow along to talk radio in the morning because I’m more than likely behind in my pop-culture. However, I find that I’m rarely at a loss for a good story from a good adventure.
And so, this weekend, as my daughter and her friend played, I listened to my daughter so confidently begin to be that “apple that didn’t fall far.” They were negotiating who was going to get time on the swings, monkey bars, and the slide of the small play structure. There came a time where I thought they may both want to be on the slide, but then Tana stepped back as the friend ran up the slide calling out, I’m climbing a Mountain, I want to stay on the slide more. Tana looked at her and then walked over to the swing. “Go ahead” she called out with no attitude intended, just a simple fact, “you can do that as much as you want because I’ve climbed a real mountain with my Mama.”
I looked up from my book to make eye contact with my swinging daughter, she titled her head, smiled, gave me the I Love You sign, and pumped her legs to swing higher.
I returned her smile, and the sign, and then returned to my book. Well Rounded With Good Stories………
Little Groovy Girls Go …………Falling Not Far From Their Tree
Climbing a Mountain at Glacier National Park, summer of 2013 when Tana was 5 years old.Here in California we have been faced with a drought for the past 7 years. If our climate does not change and we don’t get more rain fall and snow we will be facing a water shortage. What can we do now to try to save our precious natural resource?? The fastest and cheapest way is through conservation.
Here are a few easy suggestions on how to conserve water in the bathroom where the bulk of our water consumption takes place
1 – Check all faucets for leaks.
2 – Turn off the water while brushing your teeth
3 – Do not use the toilet as a garbage can
4 – Take shorter showers
5 – Change your shower head to a new water conservation shower head like the KOHLER 1.75 gpm water-conserving showerheads and handshowers deliver an impressive 30% water savings over traditional 2.5 gpm showerheads and handshowers.
6 – Install a high efficiency toilet, like the KOHLER® HETs that flush 1.28 gallons or less, when compared to a 3.5-gallon toilet, can save homeowners up to 22,000 gallons of water per fixture per year.

One response to “Think conservation”There is simply no substitute – and never will be – for observing wildlife out in the wild. There are too many behaviors that you just won’t see unless you’re in the natural environment and experiencing things firsthand. Its the lone downfall of captive collections. You can’t witness an attack by a predator on its prey and you won’t see many species of birds ever take wing inside most institutions.
I’ve come across this problem in a few instances where kids have flat out argued that flamingoes don’t fly. They do, but I can see the disconnect. When do kids ever get the chance to watch flamingoes fly? In most cases they’re lucky to see a flock of the birds surround a shallow pond or pool in a zoological setting.
While out on the Indian River Lagoon in Merritt Island today I had an opportunity to watch another pink bird make a graceful arc across the sky; a bird I’ve never seen in flight before. I’m terribly conditioned to the presence of wood storks, great egrets, snowy egrets, and great blue herons that dot the landscape across the state so I almost didnt pay attention to the high flying target. I think it was the odd pale color that first caught my attention and as I went looking for field marks I realized the bill on this bird was completely out of order for my usual observations on all the herons and storks.
Low and behold, after three autumns on the lagoon, I’ve seen my first roseate spoonbill on the wing out in the wild. I was pretty amazed by the sight, even more so than my constant excitement when we spot wild Atlantic bottlenose dolphins or clumsy manatees resting near the surface. There is something awfully exhilirating about wildlife watching. Its like an impromptu scavenger hunt; often full of experiences you’d never think to include on any to-find list..

McKeever, who competes in the visually impaired category, won three gold medals at the 2010 Vancouver Paralympics. The Cochrane, Alta., native believes it will be hard to top the emotions of competing on home soil.
"Four years goes by in a hurry," McKeever said Tuesday. "It's a chance once in a career, an opportunity many people don't get. It's going to really hard to top Vancouver."
"It was Canada's Games and you could really feel the support of Canadians right across the country."
The 34-year-old McKeever has won seven Paralympic gold medals in his career and added that he's ready to go all out again in Russia.
"We've had good prep and a good couple years of training here leading into this," he said. "It's that kind mentality that drives us and keeps us focused and performing even if we're very far away from home."
McKeever's guides Erik Carleton, of Canmore, and Whitehorse's Graham Nishikawa, were also named to the Canadian team on Tuesday, along with eight-time Paralympic medallist Colette Bourgonje.
They will be joined by Mark Arendz of Hartsville, P.E.I., Chris Klebl of Canmore, Alta., Brittany Hudak of Prince Albert, Sask., Ottawa's Caroline Bisson, Yves Bourque of Becancour, Que., Quebec City's Sebastien Fortier, Louis Fortin of Shippagan, N.B., Ottawa's Margarita Gorbounova, Robbi Weldon of Thunder Bay, Ont., and guide Andrea Bundon of Regina.
Canada's Paralympic team won 19 medals in 2010, but because of retirements only a handful of winners will be back in Sochi.
"Certainly it's tough to lose such great competitors like (para-alpine skier) Lauren Woolstencroft," said McKeever. "I mean five gold medals in Vancouver? It's going to be hard to replace five gold medals even with many people. That was amazing. She was just such an inspiration and we'll certainly miss having her firepower.
"Despite that, I think there's still good development within our own team. We've got more athletes capable of hitting the podium."
The Canada has set a goal of finishing third in the overall medal standings at the Paralympics, which run from March 7 to 16.In the Thai language, chili or pepper.
Usually followed by another term to specify which species of chili, as in prik kee noo = "mouse shit pepper". So-called because of their size and shape or their ubiquity, I'm not sure.

At the risk of oversimplifying, it doesn’t seem to have much of a point. We, the viewing audience, dive into Kevin Durant’s past to watch an apparent time traveler pretend to inform Durant of his eventual N.B.A. fate. In the lack of real purpose, we’re left to focus solely on the commercial’s aesthetic, which is as bizarre as it is false.
It’s silly to ask how we -– along with our mystery traveler -– are transported to Rockville, Maryland circa 2005. After all, beyond a typical suspension of disbelief that accompanies the commercial medium, television ads are typically constructed in a serialized manner. In Television Culture, media scholar John Fiske described the serialized form as “an infinitely extended middle,” and in a sense, that’s where these spots take (and leave) us. The year 2005 isn’t a beginning in any sense for Durant, and we’re not privileged to see the process by which our traveler makes his way into Durant’s past. There’s also no real attempt at ending or closure, marking the images we see as some sort of enduring middleness, a journey which we join in progress. If nothing else, such a structure reinforces that this tale we’re witnessing is hardly our own.
Most television commercials include some element of voyeurism; we, the viewers, are thrust into the homes or heads of some subject and we haven’t the right. Yet these ads are stranger than most because we are voyeurs of the voyeur. The traveler isn’t present at all, but viewing the same vintage Durant footage that we are. He imposes his own dialogue as if he were present, even when the opposite is painfully true. The viewing audience was never intended to buy into the commercials as being completely authentic, but it’s beyond strange that this nameless man stands preaching to Durant, who laces up his shoes while looking straight through him.
Unnecessary though it may be to wonder how this stranger stumbled into a locker room (or at least some kind of pre-game prep room) six years in the past, it’s worth questioning why he went through so much trouble -– be it converting a DeLorean into a time machine, stumbling into a wormhole, or something – just to go back and tell Durant that he’ll be playing with some young players in Oklahoma City one day. The man clearly has something invested in the Thunder (“We’re gonna love you in OKC.”), and yet of all things to pass along to the Durant of the past, the traveler elects to throw out the name of Serge Ibaka for laughs?
Why not tell Durant to urge Sam Presti to accept Tyson Chandler in a trade, regardless of what the team doctors say? Why not give Durant a little heads up that he might want to help box out Pau Gasol at the end of Game 6 in the 2010 playoffs? Or heck, when given the power of time travel, why not do something a little more self-serving or world-changing than strut into a room of high school basketball players with an I-know-the-future-and-you-don’t smirk?
Ads don’t have to make complete logical sense, but ones that follow this type of structure should at least have a purpose. It doesn’t have to be complex, or even all that meaningful; the decidedly less creepy spot featuring Amar’e Stoudemire merely focuses on two New Yorkers as they admire Stoudemire’s work ethic. That may not sound like much, but it gives the commercial cause, rather than stumble on for 30 seconds as an unknown man chuckles to himself.
The N.B.A. is blessed with a tremendously accessible game and oodles of unique stars, and that combination (along with some great ideas from the creative minds in the league’s marketing department) has generated many a memorable ad in the name of the league brand. This one misses the mark entirely, as Durant –- a humble, funny, charismatic star -– is reduced to a cardboard cutout.

Hi all I am recovering today from surgery yesterday. I have pcos on right ovary. My left ovary had a cyst size 5cm in April it was found after asking my gp for a referral to gyna ( had a previous cyst in 2006) so after more ultrasound and ct scan and meetings with gynaecologist it was decided that the cyst left ovary and tube was to be removed. Has anyone else had this done ? I have been discharged yesterday went in st 7.30, op was at 11.30 woke up at 1.30 and back to ward at 2.15 had morphine x2 during recovery but no pain from 2 pm til 8. Tried tea and half slice of toast and was sick yesterday when tried to go for a wee. Very painful to sit and I have to wait ages to wee even though I am desperate for a wee. I have noticed that where they took cyst ov and tube my tummy goes in a lot is this normal? Will it disappear? I would like to hear from anyone that's hasane e or similar procedure how long for recovery ? I'm only in pain when sitting down, lying down or standing is fine
24/08/2013 at 21:21
How was the procedure done hun? Was it laparoscopic or open surgery? I had a laparoscopy last month and was in agony from the gas that they pump into you. I found peppermint tea and peppermint oil capsules helped loads. Hope the pain gets better soon xxx
24/08/2013 at 21:34
Hi Amy thanks for the reply. I had laparoscopy, I had one before to remove a cyst, only 3 cuts last time I have 5 now. Can I ask do you have a dip in the side they took out? I'm not too bad with the gas this time I was crying with it for days last time. I have some peppermint tea at the ready it only hurt a bit early wasn't too bad!! I'm just concerned about the dip. How long was your recovery? Where did you have it Done ?
24/08/2013 at 22:36
I just had a small cyst on my right ovary and internal bleeding, they also removed my appendix for good measure lol, I did have a small dip to start with, its probably due to the swelling, it went back to normal after a week or so. I know what you mean about the gas, I woke up crying every night because I was in so much pain I couldnt move! I was up and about the day after but only briefly because of the pain and I was exhausted, also found it really difficult to stand up straight so was hunched over which caused me to have back pain too. I was pretty much recovered by 2 weeks, but took another week off work just to be safe as I have a very manual job lots of lifting etc. Xx
24/08/2013 at 23:41
My mom keeps making me laugh which then hurts my tummy calling me hunch back!! I hope the dip goes its quite big!! When my aunt was 13 they took a cyst and appendix at the same time. Ye the gas is awful glad they took most of it out this time tho !!

ANTHEM, Ariz. -- Breaking the state record for a swimming event would be a great achievement for any young swimmer. Anthony Paleo, 10, broke the Arizona record for the 50 meters breaststroke, and was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.
“I felt like I was going really fast and I just felt really proud of myself when I did it,” Anthony said.
After Paleo was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes last year, his family decided he should join the sport of swimming. His parents noticed he was beginning to lose weight toward the end of football season, so they decided Anthony should switch sports.
“It’s just more routine, it’s more balanced, and we can really balance his blood sugar levels a lot better with a consistent workout in the pool,” said Tony Paleo Sr., Anthony’s father.
Each day Anthony attends afternoon swim practice, and then tests his diabetes once he’s out of the pool. For recently beginning swimming, Anthony is already excelling at the sport.
Swimming may run in the Paleo family, as Anthony’s father was an Olympic swimmer.
“I’ll sneak in the old closet and look at old medals and ribbons to compare him and he’s much faster than I ever was, so it’s very, very rewarding,” Tony said.
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is holding their 2013 Walk to Cure Diabetes on Saturday, November 2 at Tempe Town Lake. Those wanting to participate can still sign up and support individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.Emily Sun is a freshman majoring in biology with an emphasis in zoology.

This was a bit of a hodgepodgy mess, which makes sense given the jumble of plots we have left to solve in this penultimate episode.
With Margot Al-Harazi out of the way, we were left to deal with the lurking subplot that has been working behind the scenes up until this point in the season, specifically Stolnavich, the Russian diplomat who turned out to actually be a Russian intelligence operative. The details were a bit murky, which is unfortunate given we only have one episode left, but basically Stolnavich hired Cheng Zhi to start a war between China and America... for reasons that defy logic. (That was my sarcastic voice, which I'll admit sounds a lot like my regular voice.)
Getting the override device makes sense, since it is a dangerous and scary MacGuffin. The rest, I didn't really buy it. It felt mostly like an excuse to bring back an old villain to give Jack and Audrey some closure for the obscene amount of torture they lived through. I loved how Audrey bluntly asked Jack to kill Cheng if he had the chance, and I have no doubt that Jack would do just that.
That being said, this final arc feel a bit small in comparison to the Margot arc. Maybe because I truly doubt that the show is going to plunge this fictional world into a war between the U.S. and China. It would be one hell of a bummer of an ending to the season/series. But it does ratchet up the stakes, since our heroes are literally fighting to save the world this time. Which makes me feel that they are setting up Jack to die in the next episode.
Case in point, the heartfelt conversation between Jack and Audrey. That felt like a goodbye scene, although it could be Audrey who dies. If yet another love interest for Jack dies... who am I kidding, they've already killed off like four of them already. Sheesh, that's a pretty horrible track record there, Jack.
At least Chloe had some fun moments. First she tricked Cheng into leaving behind that phone on which she had managed to record his voice. Second, she kicked ass and escaped from that truck at just the right moment. She now has the only lead to finding the override device before it leaves the country.
Unfortunately, Kate has now been relegated to Jack's sidekick. She had only a few lines, and mostly just kicked ass. This is probably because her emotional arc is now over for the most part, with the discovery that her dead husband wasn't a traitor. I'm not sure what else they have planned for her character, but I hope she has a satisfying final moment at least.
Bits:
The whole diplomatic strategy that Audrey came up with turned out to be nothing more than a set up. I'm not sure how I feel about her being in direct danger because it is so clichéd.
That long protracted firefight with the Russians at the beginning of the episode was a touch boring, which is unusual for this show.
At least Michael Wincott (Adrian Cross) got a paycheck for this episode. He's been a favorite actor of mine for a long time, and I think he played one of my favorite characters this season. His actions were at times a bit frustrating, but at least he was interesting.
I rolled my eyes when I found out Stolnavich was actually working with Cheng. Up until that point I'd thought it was nothing more than a misunderstanding because of Boudreau's screw up with the rendition paperwork for Jack.
Winner of the 'Within The Hour' pool goes to: Cheng, who has to get to the port and out of the country in less than an hour.
I wonder if Heller realized how absurd his explanation was to the Chinese president? If one of my ships had just been attacked, and the leader of the nation that attacked tried to pass off some bizarre story about a magical machine that can infiltrate any defense system, I'd be skeptical, too.
This exchange illustrates how utterly stupid Boudreau is:
Boudreau: "What happens when the bullets start to fly?"
Jack: "You're gonna want to try to stay low."
Not the best penultimate episode I've ever seen, but then again maybe it'll be better in retrospect after I've seen the finale.

I completely agree with your review, J.D. The episode felt rushed (except for that long bit at the beginning) and unsatisfying. All Kate had to do was look at Jack with concern.
I felt at the end of this episode like I feel as I approach the end to a book I am loving -- I want to know how everything is resolved, but I don't want it to end.
Having said that, I am very interested now to see how the show is going to wrap up. I'm sure that someone we care about a great deal is going to die and I am still clinging to hope that Tony appears. We shall see...
I wasn't crazy about this one, either. It didn't feel penultimate at all, and Boudreau didn't even die, which is what I was waiting for. I'm apprehensive about the finale, especially since it might be the absolute end of 24. If they leave us with an uncomfortable cliffhanger, I'm going to be massively ticked off.
Chris, I share your love for Tony, but it feels like he's too dead a character to bring back, you know? And if they were going to do it, it should have been several episodes ago. Of course, I've been wrong before. Many, many times.
I'll have to disagree with the lot of you and say that I thoroughly enjoyed this one; it would've been just about perfect were it not for the 11th hour (literally) Audrey mission that clearly was meant to a) Give her something important to do and b) Put her in danger for the finale. It was painfully obvious that her friend was going to get sniped, wasn't it?
Otherwise, this was an exciting, breakneck hour that almost felt like it had too much awesome - which is to be expected with so many balls in the air and only one hour to wrap it all up. And is it all a bit convoluted? Of course it is, but I learned back in Season 4, with Marwan's insane 88-faceted plan to just go with it and enjoy the ride, because that's what's 24 is all about. That mindset has worked for me ever since (except for Season 6, which stretched the limits of credulity too far).
And Billie, Tony wasn't "too dead a character" to bring back when he was actually supposed to be dead. 24 fans love him, and would be more likely to watch a (Kate) spinoff if he was involved. Unfortunately the writers worked themselves into a bind when they had him kill Larry Moss, making it really hard to bring him back in any governmental capacity. But if they do, I will be thrilled - and I'll be along for that ride as well :)By Poyi (Natalie) Leung
The Government has decided to raise the amount of rental allowance for households on the two social housing waiting lists by up to MOP 500 per month, and at the same time relax the income restrictions on applicants.
The Executive Council announced an administrative regulation yesterday which will extend the rental allowance scheme for one more year until August 31, 2011.
The scheme was launched in 2008 to ease the households’ financial burden of accommodation while waiting to be allocated a social housing unit.
According to the spokesman of the Executive Council Leong Heng Teng yesterday, the administrative regulation also increases the monthly allowance amount by MOP 300 to MOP 1,050 for a one- or two-member household, and by MOP 500 to MOP 1,600 for a household with three members or more.
In addition, Leong told the press conference at the Government Headquarters that the income caps imposed on the households wishing to apply for the rental allowance will be raised.
The new monthly income limit on a one-member family is MOP 6,000, up from MOP 4,480.
As for a three-member, five-member and seven-member or above family, the ceilings have been raised to MOP 11,300 (from MOP 7,070), MOP 14,300 (MOP 9,430) and MOP 17,500 (MOP 11,070) respectively.
The spokesman said the relaxation “meets the actual situation in society” and allows more families in need to benefit from the allowance.
From 2008 to September 15, 2010, the Government has spent a total of MOP 45 million on the scheme.
Among the 5,675 households on the waiting list during that period, Leong said only 2,940 applications were received and at the end 2,507 of them were approved.
The Housing Bureau on September 1 this year announced the second social housing waiting list, adding another 4,798 households into the queue.
If all the households accepted on the two waiting lists receive the rental allowance, it is expected that it will cost the Government some MOP 193 million per year, based on the calculation of a three-member family.
Extra nursery places created
Meanwhile, the Executive Council will promulgate an administrative regulation to expand the class size of 16 local child day care centres from 25 to 28 pupils.
The expansion will be able to immediately create an additional 151 places in those nurseries, Leong Heng Teng said.
Yet, the activity space for each child remains at two square metres.
Due to the space limitation, among the existing 32 child day care centres in Macau, only 16 have the condition to enrol more pupils.
According to the Social Welfare Bureau’s estimation, Macau needs to add 2,742 nursery places by 2015 in order to meet the demand as a result of the growing birth rate in the territory.
However, despite the bureau’s four different plans to work on the issue, only 1,800 places are expected to be created by the end of 2015.Thermal Control System (small)

FORT WAYNE -- Bishop John M. D'Arcy of the Fort Wayne-South Bend Roman Catholic Diocese released a statement Saturday on Pope Benedict XVI's letter concerning celebration of the Mass.
In the pope's document released Saturday, "Summorum Pontificum," Benedict removes restrictions on celebrating the Latin Mass, which the Catholic Church had largely abandoned in the 1960s.
D'Arcy addresses in his own statement Benedict's concern for those who desire greater access to the Mass as it was celebrated before and during the Second Vatican Council.
D'Arcy also notes that Benedict's letter to the church's bishops and the document concerning wider use of the Latin Mass show the pope's awareness of divisions that sometimes hardened because of the "church's failure to try to reconcile" with "those who have separated themselves from full communion with the Church over this and other issues."
About the pope's position in his decree, D'Arcy states: "I am reminded of the example of the Good Shepherd in the 10th chapter of John's Gospel: 'I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must lead them too, and they shall hear my voice. There will be one flock then, one shepherd.' "
The pope's decree goes into effect Sept. 14.
In his letter to the bishops, Benedict addresses the confusion generated by "news reports and judgments made without sufficient information."
Any fear that the decree may signal a questioning of the liturgical reform instituted by the Second Vatican Council "is unfounded," the pope states. The two versions of the Mass "is a matter of a twofold use of one and the same rite."
Benedict also states that he wants to allay the fear that use of the Latin-language missal "would lead to disarray or even divisions within parish communities."
A recent story in The Tribune detailed the concerns of parishioners at St. John the Baptist Church in South Bend, who worry that their priest, the Rev. James Seculoff, who has been reassigned and who celebrates a Latin Mass at the church, which is attended by about 80 to 90 parishioners, will not be replaced. After three years at St. John, Seculoff has been assigned to St. John the Baptist Parish in New Haven, Ind.
In his statement, D'Arcy indicates he has invited the Fraternity of St. Peter to send a priest to the diocese "to help us in the wider use of the older form of Mass" -- also known as the Tridentine Mass.

Executive Summary
Kathleen Matthews has received:
- more money from lobbyists than any Democrat running for the House in 2016 anywhere in the country
- more lobbyist money than any non-incumbent of either party running for the House in 2016 anywhere in the country
- more corporate PAC money than any non-incumbent of either party running for the House in 2016 anywhere in the country
Both Matthews and David Trone have worked only in service to their own enormous wealth (rather than the public good). Both have funneled money to anti-progressives, giving themselves a pass because business interests obviously relieve one of moral responsibility for one’s actions [sarcasm intended].
+ + +
Kathleen Matthews is running a dishonest campaign for Congress in Maryland District 8. While clogging airwaves and mailboxes with liberal pablum, she is running away from her past and present. Since she has no legislative record, the only way voters can judge what she would do in Congress is precisely what she doesn’t want voters to know.
I stipulate that true progressives don’t write checks (or cause checks to be written) to candidates and members of Congress who oppose everything we believe in. It is well known by now (and covered by me) that David Trone, the other moneybags candidate in the race, has given over $161,000 to some of the worst Republicans in the country in the cause of enriching himself. Only in the past couple weeks has Matthews’s GOP love gotten the attention it deserves.
David Lublin at Seventh State blog reports that Matthews’s record is not only worse than Trone’s but is orders of magnitude worse than her infamous $2,600 contribution to anti-birth-control Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO). In fact, Matthews has overseen over $700,000 in contributions to right-wingers, as chief lobbyist for the Marriott Corporation. (See partial list below.)
Jeffrey Hearn at Down with Tyranny blog digs even deeper into Matthews’s participation in leadership of American pay-to-play political culture.
Matthews’ [sic] title at Marriott International was Executive Vice President, Global Communications and Public Affairs. Her portfolio there included “[l]eading brand public relations, corporate communications, social responsibility, international public affairs, and government affairs.”
. . .
The Government Affairs Office is where the lobbyists are located at Marriott (the in-house ones, anyway). That office reported to Matthews when she worked there, and while she has recently attempted to distance herself from the Marriott lobbyists, she has elsewhere acknowledged that she not only oversaw their work, but also “advocated” herself on occasion.
. . .
Government Affairs at Marriott was active on many fronts. Take labor issues for instance. Soon after Matthews arrived at Marriot, opposing the Employee Free Choice Act became a priority for the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA), the trade association that has described Matthews as a “key member.”
. . .
Opposition to the raising of the minimum wage was another important labor issue that emerged during Matthews’ [sic] tenure at Marriott. The AHLA opposed such efforts furiously whether they took the form of a proposed raise in the federal minimum wage or one of the many municipal ordinances being considered in various cities across the United States.

Kathleen Matthews has received almost three dozen contributions– totaling over $100,000– from corporate PACs, as of December 31, 2015. This is more corporate PAC money than any non-incumbent of either party running for the House in 2016 anywhere in the country has received.
I began this post by accusing Matthews of running a dishonest campaign. Oppose Tyranny also sheds light on that. Zephyr Teachout , who leads anti-corruption nonprofit Mayday PAC, endorsed Jamie Raskin recently and said of Matthews that she “has been a corporate lobbyist in D.C. She is running for Congress and isn’t talking about the most central crisis we’re facing today, which is our crisis of corruption.”
Rather than addressing the accurate charge head on, the Matthews campaign split hairs, by declaring that she had not been a “registered” lobbyist. Oppose Tyranny calls this a classic “non-denial denial”: while declaring their candidate not-guilty on a technicality, they purposely ignored her obvious corruption and support for the GOP
A non-denial denial is a statement that, at first hearing, seems a direct, clear cut.
There are pro-corporate interests (e.g., the Washington Post) and voters in MD-8 who have two great options in Kathleen Matthews and David Trone. Both have worked only in service to their own enormous wealth (rather than the public good). Both have funneled money to anti-progressives, giving themselves a pass because business interests obviously relieve one of moral responsibility for one’s actions.
Real progressives also have multiple choices in this Congressional race. But only one of those, Jamie Raskin, has a clear, effective legislative and public-advocacy record to get money out of politics and deliver our political system back to the people.

Hello Keith, That was quite a detailed expose of Kathleen Matthews financial shenanigans. Hope that your expose will have some effects. Good luck for all of your good work. >

To be fair, this wasn’t *my* expose. What I did was to draw from some other blogs and repackage their research for my readers. Kudos go to the “real” work done by those I’ve cited.

Not fair to tar her with the contributions her company made. All big corporations give to both sides. All. And she isn’t the one to pick the ones to get the contributions. I get it that Raskin is cleaner, but this is an attempt to mislead the voter.

Thanks for your thoughts, AJ. I get your point, but I stand by mine: true progressives neither give to nor oversee the giving to right-wingers. If you’re not a progressive, this doesn’t matter. If you are, it damn well ought to. Also, in Matthews’s case, it wasn’t just that Marriott happened to give away that money, it’s that *she* controlled the money they were giving away.

Her cause of death appears to be a drug overdose but it could also be a homicide. NYPD Detectives Tutuola (Ice T) and Carisi (Peter Scanavino) pay a visit to the rehab center where the girl was last seen alive. They are greeted by Dr. Dennis Barkley and social worker Rosemary Taylor (Annie Corley). Turns out Barkley’s cure for troubled teen girls “is worse than the disease” of drug addiction.
Dr. Barkley is portrayed by Peter Scolari. He’s known for his roles on Girls (Lena Dunham’s father Tad), Madoff (Peter Madoff), Gotham (Commissioner Loeb), Newhart (Michael Harris), and Bosom Buddies (Henry/Hilde) with Tom Hanks, among many others. Law & Order: SVU airs Wednesdays at 9pm on NBC, right before Chicago P.D.
